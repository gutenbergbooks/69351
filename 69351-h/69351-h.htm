KNIGHT of the most Noble Order of the GARTER,<br>

CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER,<br>
and<br>
CHANCELLOR of the UNIVERSITY of Oxford,</span></p>

<p class="in4"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I am ambitious of giving dignity to this Work by
inscribing it to your Lordship; and I conceive that
it has a natural claim to your protection. It regards
those laws and that constitution which, at a most critical
period, you were called to defend; and of which
the important purposes are the security and the happiness
of a free people.</p>

<p>In this illustrious rank which divides your cares
between prerogative and liberty, and in which you
support the lustre of the Crown, while you guard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="FM_Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
independence of the subject; the greatest occasions are
afforded to distinguish the generosity of public virtue,
and to employ a capacity enlarged alike by reflection
and experience.</p>

<p>But it does not become me to say with what honour
to yourself, and with what advantages to the
nation, you sustain the arduous charge of government.
To posterity, which will not be suspected of flattery,
it must be left to celebrate the merits of an Administration,
too vigorous to yield under difficulties, and
of which the glory has increased with danger.</p>

<p class="center">I am, with the greatest respect,</p>

<p>The following <span class="smcap">Lectures</span> were delivered in the University
of <span class="smcap">Dublin</span>, and procured a very high Reputation to their
Author. The Researches they contain into the Nature and
History of the <span class="smcap">Feudal Laws</span>, were esteemed extensive and ingenious;
and the Description they exhibit of the <span class="smcap">English
Constitution</span>, will be allowed to be particularly interesting.
These Advantages have occasioned their Publication. It was
thought, that Papers, which had done so much Honour to <span class="smcap">Dr.
Sullivan</span>, when alive, ought to illustrate his Memory; and
that they might prove of Use to the present Age, and to Posterity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Authorities assigned for <span class="smcap">Dr. Sullivan’s</span> Opinions and
Reasonings are furnished by the <span class="smcap">Editor</span>. They are not, perhaps,
in every Instance those to which he himself would have
appealed. This could not have been expelled. They are
such, notwithstanding, as will assist the Student; and the Preliminary
<span class="smcap">Discourse</span>, it is hoped, will not be thought an
useless or improper Addition to his <span class="smcap">Lectures</span>. It will be a
Pleasure to the <span class="smcap">Editor</span> to reflect that he has endeavoured to
pay a Tribute of Respect to the Writings of a virtuous Man and
an ingenious Lawyer, whom an immature Death had ravished
from his Friends and from Society.</p>

</div>

<p>The last conquest attempted under the Roman Republic
was that of Britain. Julius Cæsar, on the pretence that
its states had given assistance to the Gauls, but chiefly from a
motive of glory, carried the Roman Eagles into a country from
which he was to retreat with disgrace. It required a length of
time, and a succession of able Proconsuls to reduce to subjection
Communities of fierce and independent warriours; and
policy effected what could not be operated by arms. The
Britains were debauched into a resemblance with a most corrupted
people. They renounced the fatigues of war for the
blandishments of peace. They forsook their huts for palaces;
affected a costliness of living, and gave way to a seducing voluptuousness.
They sunk into an abject debasement, without having
run that career of greatness, which, in general, precedes
the decline of nations; and, when they were trained to an oppressive
yoke, the Romans found it necessary to abandon them.
The impression which the barbarous tribes had made upon the
Empire required the presence of the distant legions<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span></p>

<p>The liberty which the Romans, on their departure, presented
to the Britains, could not be enjoyed by them. Timid and
dastardly, they fled before the Picts and Scots, and allowed
their country to be ravaged by a cruel and undisciplined enemy.
Amidst the suggestions of their fear, they forgot every principle
of policy and of prudence; they called to their defence a foreign
valour. The Saxons were invited to fight their battles;
but they acted not long as protectors. They were allured by
the prospect of compleating a settlement in this island; and the
total ruin of its inhabitants was projected. Despair gave a temporary
vigour and union to the Britains. They were unable,
however, to resist a people, accustomed to victory, and directed
by experienced commanders. The valiant and magnanimous
fell by the sword; the ignoble submitted to an ignominious servitude:
Wales afforded a retreat to some; and others found shelter
in Armorica<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>But, if the Saxon conquest was ruinous to the Britains, it was
yet attended with consequences which were lasting and important.
The sun of liberty revisited the island, and displayed itself
with uncommon lustre. The Saxons, independent in their
original seats, submitted not to tyrants in their new situation.
They laid the foundation of a political fabric, the most valuable
that has, at any time, appeared among men; and which, though
shaken by violent revolutions, a train of fortunate circumstances
has continued down to the present times. Fluctuations have
taken place between prerogative and liberty; but, accident and
wisdom have still conspired to preserve us from the fate of the
other kingdoms of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span></p>

<p>During the existence, however, of the Heptarchy, the Saxons
seem to have departed little from their original condition of Society.
The ferocious picture which Tacitus has drawn of the
Germans, is, with a few exceptions, characteristic of them. If
we admire their heroism, we are shocked with their cruelty;
and if we are in love with their democratical maxims, we must
sometimes regret their contempt of justice and of order. The
most important innovation introduced into their manners during
this æra was their conversion to christianity. But their acquaintance
with this mode of faith failed to be productive of
beneficial consequences. As they received it from the corrupted
source of the Church of Rome, it involved them in endless and
idle disputes. It detracted from the vigour of their understanding,
by turning their attention from civil precautions, and the arts of
policy, to the relics of saints, and the severities of religious discipline.
The power derived from it intoxicated ecclesiastics:
They presumed to interfere in affairs of state; and, a foundation
seemed already to be laid for subjecting the island to the
dominion of the Roman Pontiff<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>When the Saxon kingdoms were consolidated into one state
under Egbert, improvements were made in civility and knowledge.
The incursions of the Danes, and the disorders resulting
from them, called forth the ability and the wisdom of the
Anglo-Saxon Princes. Alfred, notwithstanding the other important
transactions of his reign, found leisure to frame into a
code the laws of his predecessors, and those Germanic customs
which had retained their influence. King Edgar has likeways
come down to us with the character of an able legislator. The
establishment of the Danes in England gave occasion to new
usages and new laws; but these were neither many, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
considerable<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The ability of Canute did not allow him to make
distinctions between his Danish and his English subjects; and
the sceptre was not long in returning to a prince of the Saxon
line. No Monarch was ever more acceptable to a State than
Edward the Confessor; and, though he had rather the qualities of
a saint than those of a king, his laws have been highly extolled.
They were strenuously contended for during the administration
of the earlier Norman princes; they kept their ground in opposition
to the clergy and the imperial institutions; and they
furnished the foundation of what is termed the Common Law
of England<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span></p>

<p>In no portion of the Anglo-Saxon period does the power of
the Sovereign appear to have been exorbitant or formidable.
The enaction of Laws, and the supreme sway in all matters,
whether civil or ecclesiastical, were vested in the <i>Wittenagemot</i>,
or great National Assembly<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. This council consisted of King,
Lords, and Commons, and exhibited a species of government,
of which political liberty was the necessary consequence; as its
component parts were mutually a check to one another. The
free condition of the northern nations, and the peculiarity of
their situation when they had made conquests, gave rise to this
valuable scheme of administration, and taught the politicians of
Europe what was unknown to antiquity, a distinction between
despotism and monarchy.</p>

<p>The executive power remained with the crown; but it was
the united assent of the three estates which constituted the legislature.
The Lords were spiritual as well as temporal; for notwithstanding
that the Ecclesiastics preached humility, and the
contempt of private interest, they had been seized with ambition
and the love of superiority<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. The people exercised an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
authority that was important and ample. The counties appeared
by their knights, and the cities and boroughs by their
citizens and burgesses; the Commons, as at this day constituted,
being included under the appellation of the <i>wites</i> or <i>sapientes</i>,
who are always mentioned as a part of the Anglo-Saxon
parliament<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The assertors of prerogative, indeed, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
affirmed that these were judges or men skilled in the law; but this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
opinion they support by very exceptionable evidence<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>: And it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
has been conjectured, with no measure of propriety, by some
compromising writers, that all the more considerable proprietors
of land had a title, without any election, to give their votes in
the Wittenagemot<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>In inferior assemblies, and in the forms of judicial proceedings,
the marks are also to be traced of the power of the people,
and of a limited administration. The hundred and county
courts were admirably calculated for the protection of the subject.
They were composed of <i>freeholders</i>, who were bound, under
a penalty, to assemble at stated times; and who, with the
hundreder, earl and bishop, gave decision in all matters of civil,
criminal, or ecclesiastical import. A very powerful obstruction
was thus created to the oppressions of the great. And, in the
institution of a <i>jury</i>, our ancestors possessed a bulwark, the most
efficacious and noble that human wisdom has ever devised for
the security of the persons and possessions of men<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>Nor was the condition of those times so entirely destitute of
grandeur as some historians have been fond to assert. Even
in the age of Tacitus, London was a port not unknown to navigators
and traders<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; and we have the authority of Bede, that
England abounded at an early period with cities which were
wealthy and populous<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Alfred was particularly attentive to
encourage industry, trade and manufactures; and even imported
the luxuries of life from the most distant countries<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. It
was a law of Athelstane, that the merchant, who had performed
at his own expence three long and hazardous voyages, should
be invested with nobility<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. Civility and knowledge, commerce
and wealth increased under Edgar, whose ability and affable
manners allured many foreigners to his court; and affairs did
not degenerate, nor was England less respectable under the
peaceful and fortunate administration of Edward the Confessor.</p>

<p>But the beautiful pre-eminence on the side of the people,
enjoyed during the Saxon times, was soon to be violated. The
invasion of the duke of Normandy was about to introduce sanguinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and oppressive times. We must not, however, with a
multitude of authors, be deceived into the opinion, that this
warriour and statesman atchieved a <i>conquest</i> over the constitution
and the people of England. He made effectual by arms his
right of succession to Edward; but he received the crown with
all its inherent properties. He took the oath which had been
prescribed to the Saxon princes; he acknowledged himself to
be equally under restraint and limitation; and he engaged
to preserve the immunities of the church, and to act according
to the laws. The victory he obtained at Hastings was over the
person of Harold, and not over the rights of the nation<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>His accession, at the same time, it will be allowed, was a
source of inquietude and confusion. Dominion is ever consequent
on property; and the forfeited estates of the nobility and
the landed proprietors who had assisted Harold, or who had afterwards
joined in insurrections, having been bestowed by him
on his officers; and the high rank of many of these requiring
very ample retributions, a great proportion of territory was necessarily
vested in the hands of a few. Nor was it favourable
to the spirit of democracy, that the donations of William were
governed by the more extended notions of the feudal law.</p>

<p>This polity, which was common to the northern tribes, had not
been unknown to our Saxon ancestors; but, though they were
familiar with grants, which were precarious, or which endured
for a term of years, or during the life of the feudatory, they
had seen few examples of the perpetuity of the fief. They had
not been accustomed to the last step of the feudal progress;
but a tendency to its establishment was observable among them;
and, if the invasion of William had never taken place, the institutions
of this law had yet arrived at their highest point. He
only hastened what the course of time was about to produce by
slow degrees: It was a result of his administration, that, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
the end of the reign of Henry II. fiefs, in their more enlarged
condition, had spread themselves over England<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>This plan of political law, which had been propitious to liberty
and conquest in its rise, was prejudicial to both in its decline;
and the same institutions, which in one situation, conducted
to greatness, led the way in another to confusion and
anarchy<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. The advantages which distinguished their earlier
state, were unknown when they had attained the ultimate step
of their progress. When fiefs had become hereditary, the association
of the chief and the retainer, or the lord and his vassal,
had no longer for its support, any other tie than that of land<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>;
and, if the possessor of a fief was less attached to his followers,
he was less dependent on, and less connected with his prince.
The system had lost the circumstances, which formerly had fitted
it so admirably for war; and the few regulations it included
with regard to peace and domestic policy, were rather calculated
for the narrow circle of a nascent community, than for the
complicated fabric of an extensive empire.</p>

<p>The exorbitant grants, which it was necessary that duke William
should make, the full establishment of the perpetuity of the
fief, and the consequent investment of offices of rank and of dignity
in particular families, introduced all the disorders of aristocracy.
The most princely dominion was in general claimed and exercised
by the great<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. They assumed the right of declaring war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
against each other of their private authority; they coined money;
and they affected to exert without appeal every species of
jurisdiction. But while they disputed in the field the prize of
military glory, or vied in displays of magnificence and grandeur,
their tenants and vassals were oppressed to supply their
necessities; and, amidst the unbounded rapine and licentiousness
which arose, no legal protection was afforded to individuals<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
There was no safety for the helpless but in associations
with the powerful; and to these they paid attention and service.
The tribunals of justice became corrupted; and decisions were
publickly bought from the judges. New sources of oppression
were thought of; and none were infamous enough to be rejected.
The feudal casualties were exacted with the most rigorous
severity; and, while the kingdom appeared to be divided into
a thousand principalities, the people were nearly debased into a
state of servility.</p>

<p>On a superficial view, one would be apt to imagine, that, in
regard to competition, the nobles of those times were considerably
an overmatch for the prince. But Barons, whose chief recommendations
were the military virtues, who were haughty
and independent, and often inflamed against each other with
the fiercest animosity, could not always act in a body, or by fixed
and determined maxims. It was not so with the sovereign:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
The master of operations, which depended on himself, he could
speculate in silence, and watch the opportunities of action. The
advantages he derived from his situation were powerful. Not
to mention his prerogatives and his revenue; the returns of
feudal service reminded the nobility of their subjection to him;
and the inferior orders of men, regarding these as their immediate
oppressors, looked up to him as to their guardian.</p>

<p>Amidst the lawless confusion introduced by the struggles between
regal and aristocratical dominion, the constitutional rights
of the Commons seem to have received a temporary interruption,
and to have been insulted with a temporary disregard. Their
assembling in parliament grew to be less frequent and less effectual;
and for a season, perhaps, was altogether suspended. But
notwithstanding the disorder occasioned by these struggles, they
were in time productive of effects which were beneficial to the
people. For if the charter, confirming their <i>ancient</i> liberties,
which was granted by Henry I. renewed by Stephen, and continued
by Henry II. had remained without a due and proper
force; the confederacy of the barons produced under king
John and Henry III. the revival and the exercise of the most important
privileges. The <span class="smcap">magna charta</span> brought back, in
some measure, the golden times of the Confessor. It appeared
to the barons, that they could not expect the assistance of the
people, if, in treating with John, they should only act for their
own emolument; they were therefore careful that stipulations
should be made in favour of general liberty. The people were
considered as parties to transactions which most intimately concerned
them. The feudal rigours were abated; and the privileges,
claimed by the more dignified possessors of fiefs, were communicated
to inferior vassals. The cities and boroughs received
a confirmation of their <i>ancient</i> immunities and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
customs<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Provisions were made for a proper execution of
justice; and in the restraints affixed to the power of the king
and the nobility, the people found protection and security.</p>

<p>The sovereign, no less than the nobles, was an enemy to public
liberty; and yet both contributed to establish it. Stephen
gave the example of a practice, which as it served to enfeeble
the aristocracy, was not forgotten by his successors. In the
event of the reversion to the crown of a great barony, he gave
it away in different divisions; and the tenants <i>in capite</i> produced
in this manner, threw naturally their influence into the scale
of the commons. The partitions, also, which the extravagance
of the nobility, and the failure of male-heirs, introduced into
great estates, contributed to restore the democracy. It was a
result, likeways, of the madness of the Crusades, that many adventurers
to the east returned with more cultivated manners,
and more improved notions of order and liberty; and the romantic
glory of acquiring a renown there, had induced many
potent barons to dispose of their possessions. The boroughs
hastened to recover the shock, which they had received during
the violent administrations of William and of Rufus<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; and, if
charters of corporation and community were granted seldom
during the reigns of Henry I. and of Stephen, they were frequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
under Henry II. Richard I. king John, and Henry III.
During the sovereignty, accordingly, of the last, and during that
of Edward I. the acquisitions secured by the Commons appeared
so considerable, that their assembling in parliament became
a matter of greater regularity, and they rose to their ancient importance
from the disorder into which they had been thrown
during agitated and turbulent times.</p>

<p>The 49th year of Henry III. and the 23d year of Edward I.
which so many writers consider as the dates of the establishment
of the Commons, were, of consequence, nothing more than
memorable epochs in their history<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span></p>

<p>Under Edward I. the constitution received a stability to
which it was no less indebted to his military than his civil capacity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
The wars and expeditions in which he engaged, involved
him in immense expence; and calling for supplies, rendered
him particularly attentive to the people. The feudal
force of the kingdom could not be employed by him with efficacy.
In the decline of the gothic system, the nobles were not
sufficiently in subjection to the prince; and their service was
limited to a narrow period. In the reign, indeed, of Henry II.
a pecuniary payment had been substituted in the place of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
personal attendance of the military vassal; and the custom had
prevailed of hiring soldiers of fortune. But, amidst the prevalence
of private and mercenary views, the generous principles
which had given solidity to the feudal fabric<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, having totally
decayed, and the holding by a military tenure having ceased to
be considered as an honour; vassals thought of eluding the duties
to which they were bound by their possessions, and granting
them away in fictitious conveyances, received them back under
the burden of elusory or civil donations. It even grew to be
usual among tenants to refuse the pecuniary payments, or the
<i>scutages</i> to which they were liable: They denied the number of
their fees; they alledged that the charge demanded of them
was not justified by their charters; and, while the prince was
ready to march against an enemy, it was not convenient to look
into records and registers. The sovereign deprived of his service,
and defrauded of his revenue, and under the necessity of
levying a military force, had no resource so secure or abundant
as the generosity of the people<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>The admirable improvements with which Edward enriched
the laws, and facilitated the preservation of domestic peace and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
order, contributed also with the greatest efficacy to advance and
secure the liberties of England. He established the limits of
the different courts; he gave a check to the insolence and encroachments
of the clergy; he abrogated all inconvenient and
dangerous usages; and the great charter, and the charter of
the forest, received from him the most ample settlement<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
The sagacity of his precautions and policy procured to him
most deservedly the name of the <i>English Justinian</i>; and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
mentioned as a convincing proof, both of his genius, and of his
having studied the welfare of his people, that, to the form into
which he modelled the common law, as to the administration
of common justice, the wisdom of succeeding times has not
been able to add any considerable improvements<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>The crown of Edward I. but not his talents, descended to
Edward II. The indolence, however, and the incapacity of
the last prince, joined to his absurd passion for favourites,
though they rendered his reign tumultuous and unhappy, were
no less favourable to the dignity of parliament, and the power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
of the people, than the excellent administration of Edward III.
and the necessities to which he was subjected by his ambition
and his prowess. A weak prince may lose the prerogatives
transmitted to him; but will never be the founder of a despotism.
A high-spirited monarch, dependent for resources on
his people, may carry destruction and ruin into the country of
an enemy, but will not easily be induced to attack the liberty
and the prosperity of his own kingdom.</p>

<p>The sons of Edward III. had contributed, while he lived, to
his grandeur, and that of the nation; but no sooner was he laid
in his grave, than they excited commotions. The ambition of
their posterity was still more pestilent and fatal. The wars between
the Houses of York and Lancaster deluged England with
blood. The passions of men were driven into rage and phrenzy;
and in the massacres, rather than the battles that ensued, conquest
or death seemed the only alternative. But while we turn
with sorrow from this bloody period of our story, our sympathy
is softened by the recollection, that the contending princes
brought accessions to liberty, by adding to the weight of the
Commons. The favour and countenance of the people were
anxiously solicited by both factions; and their influence failed
not to grow, while the means of extending it were offered,
and while they were courted to seize them<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>The nation, when satiated with the calamities of civil war,
thought of uniting the claims of the two hostile families. Henry
VII. the heir of the House of Lancaster, was married to
Elizabeth, the heiress of the House of York. This prince affected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
to be profound, and he has obtained that character. But
the condition of Europe at the time in which he lived, and the
situation in which he found himself, pointed out to him his
strain of conduct. He was more mysterious than wise; more
prudent than enterprizing; and more a slave to avarice than
ambition. Without having intended it, he placed the grandeur
of the Commons on the most solid foundation. In the liberty
which he granted to the nobility of breaking their entails,
he saw only the degradation of that order. The civil
wars had involved them in great expence; and the growing
commerce and refinement of the times, exposed them to still
greater. Their princely possessions flowed from them to give
dignity to the people<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. had no certain character, and was actuated by
no fixed and determined maxims. He had not the ability to
form, nor the firmness to put into execution a deliberate scheme
to overturn the liberties of his country. With less capacity
than his ancestor, his reign was more splendid; and, with a
more imperious temper, he had the art or the felicity to preserve
the affection of his subjects. The father removed the pillar
which supported the power of the nobles: The son gave a
mortal blow to the influence of the clergy. In the humiliation
of both, the Commons found a matter of triumph. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
Reformation, though it interrupted the progress of literature,
was yet highly conducive to civil liberty. The church in losing
an authority which it had never merited, and which it had
often abused, sunk into a dependence on government. The
supremacy returned to the sovereign to whom it originally belonged,
and with whom it ought constantly to have remained.
The visitation of the monasteries discovered more than the inventions
of a pious fraud; vices and abuses which cannot be
described, without conveying to the mind the impression of
whatever is most wicked and most dishonourable: Their suppression
gave encouragement to industry and to the arts; and
their wealth diffused in a thousand channels, circulated through
the kingdom.</p>

<p>The Reformation advanced under Edward VI. but it was
destined that this prince should only make his appearance on
the stage of public life, and give the hope of an able administration.
The sway of Mary was a paroxysm of religious madness.
She knew not, that when the individuals of a kingdom have agreed
to adopt a new religion, it is the duty of the sovereign
to give a sanction to it. The reformed were about to experience
whatever cruelty the extremity of a mistaken zeal can inflict.
But the fires lighted by Gardiner, Bonner, and such
abominable men, brought no converts to popery. The dread
of endangering the succession of Elizabeth prevented the parliament
from giving a check to the obstinate malignity and the
sanguinary rage of this unworthy queen; or, perhaps, the nation
had scarcely recovered the astonishment into which it was
thrown by the atrocity of her deeds, when, in the sixth year of
her reign, superstition, peevishness, and the most selfish and unhappy
passions, put an end to her life.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who had learned wisdom from misfortune, attained
the summit of political glory. The perilous condition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
affairs, on her commencing to reign, required singular moderation
and ability, and she exerted them. A sagacity, almost incapable
of mistake, directed all her operations<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. England
grew in commerce and advantages, while the rest of Europe
was agitated with contentions, and debated with the tyranny of
power. Her jealousy of prerogative was corrected by her attachment
to the felicity of her people; and the popularity with
which she reigned is the fullest proof that she preserved inviolated
all the barriers of liberty<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. The reformation which the
folly of her predecessor had interrupted, was compleated by her
prudence.</p>

<p>This accomplished princess was succeeded by James VI. of
Scotland. He substituted, in the place of ability, the affectation
of it. The English nation received him with marks of respect
which they were not to continue long. With high notions
of kingly dignity, all his actions tended to degrade it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
and, while his littleness rendered him contemptible at home, he
became an object of ridicule abroad, from his ignorance of
foreign politics. Careless in the choice of his ministers, and
supremely conceited of his own wisdom, his reign brought no
glory to the crown.</p>

<p>The great improvement, which, about this period, displayed
itself in the national manners, diffused among all ranks of men
very enlarged ideas concerning the nature and principles of
civil government. The arts had been cultivated with uncommon
success. Discoveries had been made in the most distant
regions of the globe. Commerce had brought great accessions
of wealth. The balance of property had turned with no equivocal
direction to the side of the people.</p>

<p>It was not an age for fastidious and tyrannical maxims. The
Commons knew all their strength, and were determined to employ
it. The prince endeavoured in vain to impress them with
his exorbitant notions of regal authority. Every complaint
and grievance of the subject were inquired into; every suspicious
and inclement act of prerogative was opposed. The doctrines
of the divine right of kings, and of passive obedience,
were now first heard of, and alarmed and astonished the nation.
Pretensions to power, destructive of the natural and inherent
privileges of humanity, and inconsistent with every principle of
common sense, were asserted from the pulpit, were claimed by
the sovereign. The extravagance of James awakened the thunder
which was to burst on the head of his successor.</p>

<p>Charles I. had imbibed the same lofty conceptions of kingly
power; and his character was marked by the same incapacity
for real business. His situation required insinuation and address;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
but he affected the utmost stateliness of demeanor. He
disgusted the Commons; he insulted the people. To the exercise
of his authority, he fancied there was no limitation. Inflamed
with opposition, he presumed to attack whatever was
most sacred, and most valuable among men. The imprudence
of Buckingham had not softened his obstinacy: His Queen was
indiscreet, and he confided in her. The violent councils of
Strafford precipitated his own and the ruin of his master. The
religious foppery of Laud completed what the incapacity of
James had begun: It was the cement of union between the
friends of liberty and the sect of the Puritans. The people beheld
with a fixed and a general indignation the insult and the
violence which were offered to the majesty of their laws, and to
their constitution. The flames of civil discord were kindled.
England was torn during six years with political and religious
fury. The unfortunate Charles atoned at length by his death
the disorders he had occasioned. The delegates of the people
pronounced him guilty of misgovernment and breach of trust.
“The pomp, says an eloquent historian, the dignity, the ceremony
of this transaction, corresponded to the greatest conception
that is suggested in the whole annals of human
kind<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span></p>

<p>Cromwel, the immediate cause of the death of Charles, and
of those circumstances of censure which accompanied it, astonished
at the height, to which, in the course of the civil wars,
his ambition had carried him, was induced to aspire still higher.
His genius was great, his fortune greater. On the abolition of
monarchy, he introduced into England a military despotism,
under the appellation of a common-wealth<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. From an inferior
rank, he had risen gradually to direct the affairs of a powerful
nation. Though irregular in his politics, the vigour of his
conduct brought signal glory to his councils and his arms.
But the fabric he had built was ill-contrived and ill-cemented;
its parts were disproportioned; and it rested on no solid foundation.
It began to totter during his own life. His son Richard
had none of the talents of an usurper. The minds of
the people united in an anxious wish for the re-establishment of
the ancient constitution; and general Monke acquired the honour
of the peerage, and the fame of uncommon political sagacity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
for forwarding an event, which it was impossible to prevent.</p>

<p>Charles II. never forgave the people of England for the misfortunes
he himself had suffered, nor for those of his House.
This monarch had quickness of parts, but possessed not that discernment
which sees into the future. He entered without reflection
into schemes and projects, and renounced them with
the same precipitation. Though an enemy to the constitution
of his country, and though in the interest of France, he was not
able to produce any lasting disadvantage to the kingdom. His
reign, though tumultuous, was not unfavourable to liberty.
The total abolition of the military tenures and their appendages,
which had place during his sovereignty, was a most important
acquisition to the people: It relieved their estates from
every source of legal oppression. The <i>habeas corpus</i> act, which
was some years posterior to it, offered the firmest security to
their persons. It produces in a court of justice the body of
every prisoner; it makes known the cause of every commitment;
and, if an individual has suffered confinement in opposition
to the law, though at the command of the king in council,
he is restored to his liberty, and has a claim of compensation
for the loss and the indignity his affairs and his honour
have sustained.</p>

<p>The clamour against popery was loud and violent during the
long administration of Charles II. and yet the crown was permitted
to pass to the Duke of York. This confidence, so honourable
to the people, was abused by the sovereign. James II. had
the zeal of a monk, not the virtue and the talents of a great
king. His bigotry and his lust of power made him perpetrate
the most atrocious and the most insolent acts. Violating equally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span>
civil and religious liberty, his subjects deprived him of a
throne of which he was unworthy.</p>

<p>In settling the crown on the prince and princess of Orange,
the wisest precautions were taken, that the religion, the laws,
and the liberties of England should never more be in danger of
being subverted. The limits of the prerogative were defined;
the extent of the freedom of the people was ascertained; and
the doctrine of resisting the prince, when he should presume to
encroach on the rights of the subject, was explained and illustrated<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>From the Saxon conquest, during a long succession of ages,
this fortunate island has never degenerated from liberty. In
the most inclement periods of its history, it despaired not of independence.
It has constantly fostered that indignant spirit
which disdains all subjection to an arbitrary sway. The constitution,
prospering under the shocks it received, fixed itself at
the highest point of liberty that is compatible with government.
May it continue its purity and vigour! and give felicity and
greatness to the most distant times!</p>

<p><i>The intention and purposes of political society—Customs and manners govern men
before the enactment of positive Laws—Arts and property the sources of legislation—Peculiarities
attending the institutions of Lycurgus and those of Moses—In
the infancy of a state, laws are few and plain—In times of civility and refinement,

methods which have been followed in the study of it.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Since every political society was originally framed for the general
benefit of the several individuals of which it was composed, in order
that, supported by the united strength of the whole community, each
person might have that security in his life, his liberty, his property, which,
unassisted in a state of nature, he could not of himself attain unto; and that,
instructed by the joint counsels and wisdom of the whole body, he might so
direct his actions, as to promote the public welfare, with which his own
safety and interest are necessarily connected; it follows, that, in such a state,
every man must, even for his own sake, in many things, sacrifice his private
judgment, and his natural liberty of action, to the will of that community to
which he belongs; which will, acting uniformly for the same purposes, cannot
fail of producing a number of fixed rules and regulations, to serve as
directions to the subjects, in such cases as are common, and frequently
occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>Accordingly, we find, there never was a state or nation, even but one
degree removed from barbarity, that subsisted without some general customs,
at least, which supplied the place of positive laws, by which the conduct
of the several members of the society was to be governed, and for the
breach of which they were liable to punishment; and in such a submission the
very essence of political freedom consists. For, as M. Montesquieu very justly
observes, the liberty of man in a social state, different from that in a state
of nature, consisteth not in a power of acting, in all things, according to his
own judgment, but in acting according thereto, in subservience to the will
of the public, in being free to do all things the law prohibits not, and to
omit all things the law doth not enjoin<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, in all such infant states, the greatest respect is paid, and the
highest influence allowed to those, who, either by their age and experience,
or, by their application and labour, have arrived at a proficiency in the
knowledge of the customs and practices prevailing in their own and neighbouring
nations: <i>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes</i>, is the great
eulogium of the most accomplished hero of the heroic ages.</p>

<p>It must be allowed, indeed, that, in societies so small that their members
are, in general, contented with little more than the bare necessaries of nature,
a few rules will be sufficient; and every man of a tolerable capacity
will, with a reasonable degree of observation, be, in some measure, qualified
to be his own lawyer. But when it shall happen that arts are not only
introduced, but become common among any people, when the comforts
and conveniencies of life are, in the public opinion, esteemed necessaries;
when the industry of some, and the negligence of others, have produced a
remarkable inequality in the goods of fortune; when riches hath brought
forth her offspring, insolence and oppression, and when envy and avarice
inflame the breasts of the indigent, it will be absolutely necessary to lay a
continual restraint on such violent passions, ready at every instant to destroy
the peace of society, and to tear it into pieces, and, for that purpose, to
form a great number of regulations, to curb those who have created to
themselves imaginary wants, and who no longer regulate their conduct by
the plain dictates of rude and simple nature. And as the condition of such a
nation must be perpetually changing, as new arts and gratifications will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
continually invented, as the increase of commerce will every day open a prospect
of more various acquisitions, and insensibly introduce a general change
of manners in the people; and, above all, as the wits of men, checked in
their darling pursuits, will ever be at work to discover methods of eluding
those laws which they dare not openly infringe, there must ensue a constant
alteration and variation of the rules already in being, and a continual addition
of new ones to answer new and unforeseen emergencies. The laws,
therefore, of a nation so circumstanced, must increase to such a number, and
consist of so great a variety of particulars, as to render it impossible for the
generality of the subjects to be masters of them, and will oblige them to
resort to those whose easy circumstances and leisure have enabled them
thoroughly to comprehend and understand them; and among such a people
there must be <i>lawyers</i>, although, perhaps, not formed into a distinct and
separate profession, or known by that appellation.</p>

<p>Great, undoubtedly, are the inconveniencies which attend a multiplicity
of laws, and very hard it seems, that all men should be obliged to obey a
rule, which it is confessed the majority are incapable of perfectly knowing;
but such is the natural and necessary course of things. If men will not be
contented to live in a state next to absolute barbarity, if they will enjoy the
conveniencies as well as the necessaries of life, if they will be secured against
the oppression and fraud of their fellow subjects, as well as against the violence
of strangers, they must submit to and abide by the consequences. And
so sensible of this necessity was the great Spartan legislator, that when he resolved
his state should admit of no addition to, or alteration of his regulations,
he wisely stopped up the sources from which new laws spring. Commerce,
and its instrument, money, were prohibited; all arts, except those
absolutely necessary, were interdicted, and the people, by constantly living
and eating in public, were not only accustomed, but necessitated to content
themselves with what simple nature requires. By these means (and by these
only, or by others similar to these, could it be accomplished) Lycurgus
gave a firmness and stability to his republic, which continued for several
hundred years, until conquest introduced wealth, and its necessary attendants,
which soon eat out the vitals of that singular constitution<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>The law of Moses, likewise, was invariable, and admitted of no additions
or alterations; and as, from the peculiar circumstances of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
and its situation, there was no danger of an accumulation of wealth from
foreign commerce, so were the domestic regulations inimitably calculated to
prevent a great inequality of circumstances, and to oblige the nation in general
to a plain and simple life. All usury among the Israelites was prohibited,
the lands were alienable no longer than to the year of jubilee, at which
time they returned free to the original proprietor or his heirs; and, by the
invariable rules of descent, and the continual dividing of estates among all
the males in equal degree, every man was proprietor of some small patrimony,
and consequently obliged to live in a frugal and laborious manner<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
Athens, on the contrary, the most commercial and the richest city of
Greece, abounded, above all others, in a multiplicity of laws, and those,
for the causes already mentioned, perpetually varying and changing. Rome,
while it continued a mere military state, was contented with a few, and
those such as were short and plain; but when, by the conquest of Carthage,
of Greece, and of Asia, floods of wealth were poured into Italy, the necessary
consequences soon followed. New laws were continually made, which,
being as continually eluded, of course gave birth to others. Every new
conquest brought an accession of riches, and became a source of farther regulations:
until, at length, they swelled to such a magnitude, as to become,
in the time of Justinian, an intolerable burthen: For, to say nothing
of the laws themselves, the <i>senatus consulta</i>, the <i>plebiscita</i>, the <i>edictum
perpetuum</i>, and the constitutions of the emperors, which were very voluminous,
the bare commentaries of the lawyers of authority amounted to
three thousand volumes.</p>

<p>If we look around the nations that now inhabit Europe, we shall find
that the same causes have constantly, every where, produced the same effect.
How few, how short, how plain, and simple, were the antient laws
of the Saxons, the Franks, the Burgundians, the Goths, and the Lombards,
while each of them continued a plain and simple people<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. As they
increased in arts and wealth, as their kingdoms grew more powerful, either
from internal peace and commerce, or by the melting of different sovereignties
into one, we might see the laws gradually increase in number and in
length; this arose from the necessity their legislators were under, from the
different circumstances of the times and people, to enter into details of
which their ruder ancestors had no conception: and this augmentation hath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
ever been in proportion to the wealth and power of the people that was
obliged to admit it; as might easily appear by fixing on any one period,
and by comparing the laws of those nations where arts and trade were fully
established, with those of others where they had not yet got so firm a footing.</p>

<p>Within these last two hundred and fifty years, the inhabitants of Europe
in general, particularly those that have any considerable share in universal
commerce, seem to have been seized with an epidemical madness of making
new laws; insomuch that there is scarce a state whose laws, since the year
1500, are not equal, if not superior, in number and bulk, to those made
in many preceding ages: an effect owing, partly to the decay of the old
military system, and to the necessity every government was under, to have
recourse to new methods for its support, when that failed; but principally
to the discoveries of America, and of the passage to the East Indies; which,
by the peaceful arts of industry and trade, have poured into modern Europe
an accession of treasure, equal to what was amassed in Italy by conquest
and rapine under the Roman empire. As Britain, during this interval,
shared more largely than any other country in this vast increase of wealth,
it is not surprising that her later laws have been numerous and voluminous
in proportion.</p>

<p>But there is another cause peculiar to these nations, which hath not a little
contributed to the same end, namely, that happy constitution, and that liberty
in which we so justly glory. A constitution which lodges the supreme,
the legislative power in three different hands, each of which (if considered
apart) hath an interest separate and distinct from the other two, must
require a variety of wise regulations, so to ascertain their respective rights
and privileges, and so to poise and balance them, as to put it out of the
power of any one to overtop the others. A constitution that admits the
people, by representation, to so considerable a share of power, must have
many laws to determine the manner of elections, and the qualifications both
of electors and elected. A constitution that makes the preservation of political
freedom its great object, and that aims to defend the life, liberty, and
property of the meanest individual, not only against others of their own
rank, but even against the executive power of the society itself, must have
many extraordinary fences, and barriers, to protect the weak from the mighty.
Such a constitution must, more particularly than others, restrain its judges,
the dispensers of justice, who are, at the appointment of the crown, to follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the strict letter of the positive laws; lest, under the pretence of explaining
and extending them, the most valuable privileges of the people might be
betrayed, or rendered illusory. And this very restraint, so necessary in such
a form of government, will eternally (as new cases arise, which, not being in
the contemplation of the legislature at the time, were not comprehended in
the words of the old provisions) occasion the framing of new ones.</p>

<p>The state and condition of these kingdoms are such, therefore, as necessarily
require a great number of laws; and heavy as the burden of them may
seem, it should be borne with chearfulness, by all who esteem the conveniencies
of life, and the perfection of arts, more than a rude and simple state
of nature; who think wealth more eligible than poverty, and power than
weakness; or lastly, who prefer our excellent form of government, and its
mild administration, to the despotic tyrannies of Asia, or the more moderately
absolute monarchies of Europe.</p>

<p>From what hath been already observed, the difficulties attending this study
in these kingdoms will readily appear; but these, instead of discouraging,
should animate every gentleman, and inspire him with resolution to surmount
them; when he considers them as inseparable from the happy situation in
which we are placed, and that the character of an upright and skilful
lawyer is one of the most glorious, because one of the most useful to mankind;
that he is a support and defence of the weak, the protector of the injured,
the guardian of the lives and properties of his fellow citizens, the vindicator
of public wrongs, the common servant both of prince and people, and,
in these countries, the faithful guardian of those liberties in which we pride
ourselves, and which the bounteous Creator bestowed originally on all the
sons of Adam, and would have continued to them, had they continued
worthy of the blessing.</p>

<p>From hence, likewise, abundantly appears the necessity of proper
methods being pointed out for the study of the laws, and of proper assistance
being given to the youth intended for this profession. This was always
allowed, and for this purpose were the inns of court originally founded;
and it must be owned, that in ancient times, they, in a great measure, answered
the end. Their exercises, in those days, were not mere matters of
form, but real tests of the student’s proficiency. Their readers laid down,
in their lectures, the principles of particular parts of the law, explained the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
difficulties, and reconciled the seeming contradictions, though, at the same
time, it must be owned, too many of them exerted themselves in displaying
their own skill and depth of knowledge in the profession, rather than in removing
the obstructions, and smoothing the ruggedness which are so apt to
discourage beginners, and which all beginners must meet in this untrodden
path, without a guide. But, since the time that these aids have been there
laid aside, and that, in the midst of so great and so rich a city, any degree
of restraint or academical discipline, to keep the students constantly attentive
to the business they are engaged in, hath been found impracticable, it
has been the wish of every considering person, that the elements of this
science should be taught in some more eligible place, where the students
may at once have the benefit of a proper method of instruction, and by
proper regulations be obliged to improve themselves in a study so important
both to them and the public.</p>

<p>That the universities, the seats of all other branches of learning, are
the places most fit for this purpose, hath been so fully proved by
Mr Blackstone, in his preliminary lecture, not long since reprinted in this
kingdom, that it will be much more proper and decent for me to refer gentlemen
to that excellent performance, than to weaken his arguments, by repeating,
in other words, what he has demonstrated, with such force of
reason, and elegance of expression. I shall only add to what he hath observed,
that every other nation of Europe hath admitted the profession of
their municipal laws into their universities, and that the same hath been the
opinion and practice of almost every age and country, as far back as the lights
of history extend. Were not the laws of Egypt, as well as their religion,
physick, history, and sciences, taught in the colleges of their priests? It is
allowed by all, that the principal employment in the schools of the prophets
was the study of the law of Moses; and, to come to more modern times,
the very first universities that were ever founded by royal authority, were
the works of Roman emperors, and erected merely for this profession.
The famous academies of Rome for the west, and of Berytus for the east,
furnished that extensive empire with a constant succession of excellent lawyers,
whose names, and the fragments of whose works were held in the
highest honour, until the inundation of barbarians from the north of
Europe, and the prevailing arms of the Saracens in the east extinguished
the Roman government in those parts. But that of Constantinople, founded
soon after the translation of the seat of empire thither, had a more happy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
destiny, flourished with distinguished reputation to these later ages, and
perished not, but with the empire itself, when that city was taken by the
Turks. Nay, so sensible were the Arabs themselves, who destroyed the
Roman academy of Berytus, of the utility of such institutions, that, for
their own law, they erected others of the same nature in Bagdad<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>Another powerful reason for laying the foundation of this branch of learning
in these seats of literature, arises from the great utility, or rather, indeed,
necessity, that all gentlemen bred in them are under, of gaining a general
idea, at least, of the principles and practice of the law of their country.
How advantageous this would be to every rank of gentlemen, whether legislators,
magistrates, divines, or jurymen; and to all, in short, who have any
property, to preserve, or transmit, or who have wishes or desires to acquire
any, may be seen at large, illustrated by Mr Blackstone in the same performance.
And indeed, if, before the attempt, there could be any doubts
of the propriety of beginning this study in an university, the extraordinary
success of his lectures in Oxford, and the high reputation he hath so
justly acquired thereby, leave no room for entertaining such at present. For
though much of both must be attributed to the singular abilities of that
gentleman, yet it must be allowed that the most skilful gardener cannot
make a tree flourish in a soil unnatural to its growth. With the deepest
gratitude, therefore, should the members of this university acknowledge
the munificence, and the wisdom of our present most gracious Sovereign,
who established the present foundation for the benefit of the youth of
this kingdom.</p>

<p>But if the importance of this institution to the public be considered, together
with the difficulties attending the just execution of it, when these
difficulties are enhanced by the novelty of the attempt, when the public
attention is engaged by that very novelty, and when the future success of
the foundation, may, perhaps, in some measure, depend on the opinion
conceived of it at the beginning; he must, indeed, be possessed of a very
overweaning opinion of his own abilities, who can undertake so arduous a
task, without feeling strong apprehensions at the first setting out. All the
return the person thought worthy by this learned body to fill this chair can
make them for so high an honour, and so important a trust, is to assure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
them, that the utmost care, and the greatest exertion of what knowledge
and abilities he possesseth, shall be employed to answer the ends proposed,
and to justify, as far as in him lies, the choice they have made. And if the
young gentlemen for whose benefit these lectures are designed, possessed
with a just notion of the great utility to themselves, and their country,
of the study they are engaged in, will exert that industry, for the honour
of their mother university, which hath made her so long famous for other
branches of learning; he doubteth not but his weak endeavours at the first
essay, will not only merit indulgence, but in the end be crowned with considerable
success. On their assiduity, as well as upon his skill, must the
success of the undertaking depend.</p>

<p>In the next lecture the grounds and reasons of the plan proposed, as most
proper for the commencing this study in this university, shall be laid open,
in hopes that the students will proceed with the more alacrity, if they can
be once convinced they are set in the right track, and that, by the professor’s
laying before the public the inducements he had to prefer this before
any other, he may acquire information from the skilful of its errors and
imperfections, and, consequently, alter it, so as most effectually to answer
the useful ends of the institution.</p>

</div>

<p>Having, in the preceding lecture, shewn the necessity of a proper
method being pointed out for the study of the laws of these kingdoms,
from the utility, as well as multiplicity of them; and having explained
from whence that multiplicity arises, and that it is inseparable from
the happy situation we are placed in; and having acknowledged the great
advantage the students of Oxford have received from Mr. Blackstone’s lectures,
it will doubtless be thought necessary, that something should be said
by way of illustration of the plan proposed to be followed here, and in
justification of its departure from the excellent one which that gentleman
has given us in his analysis. The method of instruction intended to be pursued
in this place is not proposed as more perfect, or absolutely better in itself,
but as one that appears more adapted to the circumstances of our students;
and as it will be allowed, that his course of lectures, in the manner
they proceed, hath some great advantages as to the finishing a lawyer, which
cannot be attained, and therefore should not be attempted here, it will be
particularly the duty of your professor to compensate for those, by guarding
against some inconveniencies, which the extensiveness of his plan must of
necessity subject young beginners to. I shall, therefore, proceed briefly to
compare the situation of the two universities, in hopes, by that consideration,
in some measure to vindicate the several particulars wherein I have
chosen to vary from his scheme. The attendance on the courts of Westminster-Hall,
when once a gentleman hath read and digested enough to
listen with understanding to what he there hears, hath, for a succession of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
ages, been allowed to be, and it must be owned is, the most effectual
means of accomplishing a lawyer, and fitting him for practice. In this respect
Oxford, in her proximity to Westminster, hath certainly an advantage,
as to her law students of above two years standing, who may at that time
be supposed capable of improvement by the arguments in the courts of law;
as she is thereby rendered capable of conjoining those two excellent methods
of instruction. Mr. Blackstone was fully sensible of this happy circumstance,
and, accordingly, his scheme is adapted to it. All the lectures there
are appointed at times that fall in the law vacations, and the course is general
and diffusive, not calculated merely for attendants of the first and
second years, but adapted also to those of a more advanced standing, and
consequently, in a manner equally copious, or very nearly so, illustrates
every one of the several branches of the English law. But this method,
however excellent in itself, and most eligible where gentlemen can have an
opportunity of attending the professor for several successive years, must, on
the other hand, be allowed to labour under some inconveniencies, especially
as to those who are yet novices, which, as it should be the particular care
of the professor here to obviate, it cannot be improper briefly to point out.</p>

<p>As the lectures of the English professor are all read in the law vacations,
and in all of them, except the long one, when few young gentlemen of fortune
stay in the universities, the shortness of these vacations necessarily occasions
these lectures to follow each other in a very quick succession; and, accordingly,
we find that five are delivered in every week. It is impossible,
therefore, that the students at first should keep any manner of pace with
their professor in their private reading, without which the ablest performances
in the way of prelections will be of little utility. Many things in
the succeeding ones must be rendered very difficult, if not absolutely unintelligible,
for want of a due time for mastering and digesting those that preceded;
and another unhappy consequence of this quick succession is, that
the most useful and effectual method of instruction to beginners, at their
entrance upon any science, namely, a continued examination of the progress
they have made, is hereby entirely precluded, and rendered impracticable.
The great advantage of that method need not be enlarged upon in
this place, as every gentleman who hears me must be already fully satisfied
of it from his own experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>But this university is circumstanced in a very different manner. The
necessity our students are under of repairing to Westminster, to finish their
studies, before they are called to the bar, and their incapacity to reap any
benefit from the courts of law while they reside here, render it impossible,
as well as unnecessary, to conjoin those two methods of instruction before-mentioned,
as is done at Oxford; and, by confining the professor to pupils
of two years standing or little more, make it highly improper for him
to enter minutely into those parts of the law his audience have not
yet had time to apply to. His great object, therefore, should be so to
frame his lectures, as to be most useful to youth at the beginning, to be
particular and copious in the elementary parts, in order to lay a sure foundation,
and to smooth and make plain the difficulties which at first will
every where occur. And as, for these reasons, a general and equally diffusive
course is a method improper for him to pursue, it should be his especial
care to avoid, or remedy the inconveniencies with which such an one
is necessarily attended.</p>

<p>It is a well known truth, that the entrance on any study, however easy
and agreeable such study might be after some progress made in it, is at
the beginning very irksome, and attended with many perplexities; principally
arising from the use of new terms, whose significations are yet unknown.
But the laws of all nations, and those of England above all
others, abound in such novel words, and old ones used in an uncommon
sense, more than any other science, and therefore must be attended with
difficulties in proportion. And although many of its terms occur frequently
in common conversation, and may, consequently, be supposed already
understood, this is rather a disadvantage than otherwise; for in common
discourse they are used in so vague and undetermined a meaning, and so
far from strict precision and propriety, that it is no wonder so many persons
exclaim at the absurdity of its maxims; which, though frequently in their
mouths, they do not really understand. Young gentlemen, then, have
not only many new words to acquire the signification of, but they must
likewise unlearn the import of many others they are already acquainted
with, and affix to those familiar terms new and precise ideas, a task, as
Mr. Locke observes, of no small difficulty, and that requires not only the
strictest attention, but constant care and frequent repetition. Another great
difficulty the study of the law of England labours under, peculiar to itself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
is that want of method, so obvious to be observed, and so often complained
of in its writers of authority, insomuch, that almost all of them, and lord
Coke particularly, are too apt to puzzle and bewilder young beginners;
whereas other laws, the civil, the canon, the feudal, have books of approved
authority, (and none other but such should be put into the students
hands,) calculated purposely for the instruction of novices; wherein the
general outlines of the whole law are laid down, the several parts of it properly
distributed, its terms explained, and the most common of its rules and
maxims, with the reasons of them, delivered and inculcated. It is not to
be admired then that Sir Henry Spelman so pathetically describes his distress
at his first entrance upon this study. <i>Emisit me mater Londinum, juris
nostri capessendi gratia, cujus cum vestibulum salutassem, reperissemque linguam
peregrinam, dialectum barbaram, methodum inconcinnam, molem non ingentem
solum, sed perpetuis humeris sustinendam, excidit mihi fateor animus</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>These then are the obstructions to be removed, and the difficulties
to be obviated, by a professor who considers it his business to lead by
the hand young gentlemen, yet strangers to the study; and for this
purpose he should exert his utmost care and attention, not to overburthen
the memories, or to distract the attention of his audience with too great
variety at first, but to feed them with knowledge as he finds them capable,
and to give them time, by reading and meditation, to become masters of
what they have already acquired, and by frequent examinations to satisfy
himself they thoroughly comprehend and retain the substance of his past
lectures. The utility of this last method, by which the students will be laid
under a necessity of reading in private, as to them, will be readily allowed;
but taken in another view will be of no less assistance to the professor himself,
in framing the prelections he is to read. He will not only be encouraged
to proceed with more alacrity, when he daily observes the success of
his endeavours, but also, by the trial, be convinced of any defects or errors
in his plan that before escaped his observation, and will be warned thereby
to amend them; and he will by this means be particularly and perpetually
cautioned against the great and too common mistake of tutors, namely,
their imagining that such explications as are easy and familiar to them, will
be equally obvious to unexperienced youth. But an examination will demonstrably
shew him where his illustrations have been defective or obscure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and will oblige him to accommodate his lectures to the capacity and progress
of his hearers. The next variation in the present plan from that of
Mr Blackstone, to be taken notice of, is the proposal of beginning with the
law of <i>things</i>, not with the law of <i>persons</i>, as he hath done. It must be allowed
impossible thoroughly to understand the law of things, without some
previous knowledge of that of persons; but it is equally impossible to be
master of the law of persons, without an acquaintance with that of things.
Since, therefore, we must begin with one of them, perhaps it will be sufficient
to observe, that such knowledge of the names and relations of persons,
as is generally acquired by observation, before a person arrives at an age fit
for engaging in this study, will enable him tolerably to understand the law of
things; and that whatever more is necessary, and hath not been attained by
this means, may be easily supplied as the student goes on. And, that I
may not be thought to lean too much on my own opinion in this particular,
I shall quote the famous Sir Matthew Hale to the same purpose; who, in his
Analysis, introduces the law of things in the following manner: “Having
done with the rights of persons, I now come to the rights of things; and,
though, according to the usual method of civilians, and of our ancient
common law tractates, this comes in the second place, and after the <i>jura
personarum</i>, and therefore I have herein pursued the same course; yet that
must not be the method of a young student of the common law, but he
must begin his study here, at the <i>jura rerum</i>; for the former part contains
matter proper for the study of one that is well acquainted with those <i>jura
rerum</i><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.” And, agreeably hereto, the wisdom of ages hath declared
<i>Littleton’s Tenures</i>, which contains the common law of England, as far as it
concerns real property, that is, lands or interests derived out of and flowing
from them, to be the book most proper for students to begin with, in their
study of the law of these nations.</p>

<p>Taking it then for granted at present, that the law of real property is the
fittest introduction, it will be necessary, as it is confessed to be the most
important, the most extensive, and, in consequence, the most difficult part,
to lay the foundation deep and sure, and to derive its rules from what is
now universally allowed to be its source, the feudal customs. This, indeed,
hath been denied by Lord Coke, and others of his age; who thought it
would depreciate the excellence of the laws of their country, to admit they
were derived from any other nation. But if those gentlemen had read over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
but once the two books of the feudal law with tolerable attention, they
must have received conviction, that one of the laws was certainly derived
from the other; and which of them was so would easily appear, by comparing
the law of England after the conquest, with that which prevailed in
the Saxon times, and was not strictly feudal, exclusive of the testimony of
the old historians.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, for this purpose, it may be thought sufficient to explain
and deduce these rules from the feudal ones, as they occur occasionally
in the books of the common law; which is the method, that, in conformity
to the rest of his plan, the Oxford professor has adopted, and that the
reading through a course of that law, even the shortest, will be attended
with an unprofitable delay, and detain the students too long from their
principal object. The answer to this objection is short, and, if well
founded, perfectly satisfactory. It is, that the real reason of proposing a
system of the feudal law to be gone through, was to save time. The method
is so much better, and clearer, and, by necessary consequence, so much
easier to be comprehended, and retained, that the delay will be abundantly
compensated, and one third at least of Littleton will be understood, and
known by the students, before they open his book. For the maxims of the
common law, as they lie dispersed in our books, often without reasons, and
often with false or frivolous ones, appear disjointed and unconnected, and
as so many separate and independent axioms; and in this light very many
of them must appear unaccountable, at least, if not absurd; whereas, in
truth, they are almost every one of them deducible, by a train of necessary
consequences, from a few plain and simple rules, that were absolutely necessary
to the being and preservation of such kind of constitutions as the
feudal kingdoms were. The knowledge of which few, timely obtained,
will obviate the necessity of frequent and laboured illustrations, as often as
these maxims occur in our law, will reconcile many seeming contradictions,
and will shew that many distinctions, which at first view appear to be without
a difference, are founded in just and evident reason: to say nothing of
the improvement the mind will attain by exercise, in following such a train
of deductions, and the great help to the memory, by acquiring a perfect
knowledge of the true grounds of those various rules, and of their mutual
connection with and dependence on each other. <i>Ignoratis causis rerum, ut
res ipsas ignoretis, necesse est</i>, is a maxim frequently in our lawyers mouths;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and Littleton and Coke continually exhort the student to explore the
grounds and reasons of the law, as the only safe foundations to build on,
and deny that any man, without being perfectly acquainted with them, can
merit the honourable appellation of a lawyer.</p>

<p>But there is another, and, for gentlemen of rank and fortune particularly,
a more important consideration, that renders a general acquaintance
with the principles of the feudal law very proper at all times, but at present
eminently so; namely, the necessity of knowing these, for the understanding
the nature of those Gothic forms of government, which, until
these last three hundred years, prevailed universally through Europe, and
whence the present constitution, with several corrections and improvements
indeed, in which these islands are now so happy, is undoubtedly derived.
From hence only shall we be able to determine whether the monarchy of
England, as is pretended, was originally and rightfully an absolute royalty,
controuled and checked by the virtue of the prince alone, and whether the
privileges of the subjects, which we are so proud of, were usurpations on the
royal authority, the fruits of prosperous rebellion, or at best the concessions
of gracious princes to a dutiful people, and revocable by them or
their successors, whenever, in their opinion, their vassals should become
undeserving; principles that were industriously, and, to the misfortune of
a deluded royal family, too successfully propagated during the last century,
and that, of late, have been revived and defended, with no less zeal, than
seeming plausibility. Every man, indeed, of candour and humanity, will
look with tenderness on the errors of princes, unhappily educated in mistaken
notions, and make due allowances for the weight which arguments
urged with great apparent force of reason, concurring with the lust of
power, so natural to the human breast, will certainly have on such minds;
but, surely, this indulgence may be carried too far, and will be allowed so to
be, if, for their justification, it shall appear, upon examination, that the
history of past ages has been partially delivered down, and perverted; and
that to the vain and unprofitable grandeur of the prince, the happiness of
millions, and their posterity, hath been attempted to be offered up in sacrifice.
The question is of a matter of fact; for on the decision of the fact,
how the constitution of England antiently stood, the question of the right
solely depends. And surely it is the duty of every gentleman to inform
himself, on the best grounds, whether those great men, who, for a succession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
of ages, exposed their lives in the field, or exerted their eloquence and
wisdom in the senate, for the purpose of preserving, and perpetuating these
privileges, deserved the honourable name of patriots, or the detestable appellation
of rebels; whether the grievances our glorious deliverer came to
redress were real or imaginary; or, if real, were such as our fathers were in
conscience bound to submit to; and whether we can with justice give to
the family that now fills our throne with such lustre and dignity, that title
which they have always esteemed as their highest honour, of being the lords
of freemen, and the assertors of the liberties of mankind.</p>

<p>As the book<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which it is intended the young gentlemen shall read for
the purpose of acquiring a general idea of the feudal law, is composed
in a systematical method, it is proposed that these lectures shall proceed
in an historical one, in order to shew the original reasons of those customs,
and to point out from what small beginnings, and by what particular
steps and gradations the mighty fabrick rose. By this means the additions
to, and the alterations of the law will be seen in a clearer light, when
we are acquainted with the nature of the regulations already in being; and
by knowing the circumstances of the times, can at once perceive the wisdom
and necessity of such additions and alterations. And it is hard to
imagine a study more improving, more agreeable, or better adapted to a
liberal mind, than to learn how, from a mere military system, formed and
created by the necessities of a barbarous people, for the preservation of their
conquests, a more extensive and generous model of government, better
adapted to the natural liberties of mankind, took place; how, by
degrees, as the danger from the vanquished subsided, the feudal policy
opened her arms, and gradually received the most eminent of the conquered
nation to make one people with their conquerors; how arts and commerce,
at first contemptible to a fierce and savage people, in time gained credit to
their professors, and an admittance for them into the privileges of the society;
and how, at length, with respect to the lowest class of people, which still
continued in servitude, its rigour insensibly abated; until, in the end, the
chains of vassalage fell off of themselves, and left the meanest individual, in
point of security, on an equal footing with the greatest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Thus much has been thought necessary to observe, in order to shew the
reasons of proposing a course of the feudal laws, as an introduction to the
English; to which may be added, that this method hath received the approbation
of many good judges, and hath, in experience, been found not
only useful for the end proposed, as it is the constant practice in Scotland,
whose laws, except in the manner of administering justice, differ little from
ours, and hath been also used in England with good success; but, at the
same time entertaining, and improving in other respects.</p>

<p>As we are to begin, therefore, with this law, the observations on the remaining
parts of the plan may be, for the present, deferred; I shall, in my
next lecture, begin to deduce the origin of this law, and of its rules, from
the customs of the German nations, before they invaded the Roman empire.</p>

<p><i>An enumeration and confutation of several opinions concerning the foundation
of the feudal customs—The origin and rules of the feudal law to be deduced
from the institution of the German nations before they invaded the Roman empire—The
English indebted for this law to the Franks—A general description
of this people, with an account of the several orders of men into which they
were divided while they continued in Germany.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The feudal customs succeeded the Roman imperial law in almost
every country in Europe, and became a kind of a <i>jus gentium</i>; but
having sprung up in rude illiterate ages, and grown by slow degrees to
a state of maturity, it is no wonder that very different have been the opinions
concerning their origin, and that many nations have contended for the
honour of giving them birth, and of having communicated them to others.
Several eminent civilians, smit with the beauty of the Roman law, and filled
with magnificent ideas of the greatness of that empire, have imagined that
nothing noble, beautiful, or wise, in the science of legislation, could flow
from any other source; and, accordingly, have fixed on Rome as the parent
of the feudal constitutions. But as the paths of error are many, and disagreeing,
so have their endeavours to make out, and defend this opinion,
been various in proportion; a short mention of them, and a very few observations,
will be sufficient to convince us, that they have been all mistaken.</p>

<p>First, then, some civil lawyers have discovered a likeness between the
Roman patrons and clients, an institution as early as Romulus himself, and
the feudal lords and vassals<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. The clients, we are told, paid the highest
deference and respect to their patrons, assisted them with their votes and
interest; and, if reduced to indigence, supplied their necessities by contributions
among themselves, and portioned off their daughters. On the
other hand, the patrons were standing advocates for their clients, and
obliged to defend, in the courts of law, their lives and fortunes. The like
respect was paid by vassals to their lords, and similar assistance was given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
to their wants. The fortune of the first daughter, at least, was always paid
by them, and if they were impleaded, they called in their lords to warrant
and defend their lands and other property. Thus far, we must confess,
there is a strong resemblance; but the differences are no less material, and
shew plainly that the one could not proceed from the other. The connection
between the patron and the client was merely civil; whereas the relation between
the lord and the proper vassal was entirely military; and his fealty to
his superior was confirmed by the sanction of an oath, whereas there was no
such tie between patron and client. The aids which the tenant gave to his
lord’s necessities, except in three instances, established by custom, to redeem
his lord’s body taken in war, to make his eldest son a knight, and for the
first marriage of his eldest daughter, were purely voluntary. But the great
point which distinguishes them was, that whereas the Roman client’s estate
was his absolute property, and in his own disposal, the feudal vassal had but a
qualified interest. He could not bequeath, he could not alien, without his
lord’s consent. The <i>dominium verum</i> remained with the lord to whom the
land originally had belonged, and from whom it moved to the tenant.
Upon the failure therefore of the tenant’s life, if it was not granted transmissible
to heirs, or if it was, on the failure of heirs to the lands, it reverted
to the original proprietor. Neither was the lord, on all occasions, and in
every cause, bound to be his vassal’s advocate, or, as they express it, <i>bound
to warranty</i>, and obliged to come in and defend his tenant’s right and property.
For the fealty on one side, and the protection on the other, extended
no farther than the feudal contract; and therefore the one was not
bound to warrant any of the tenant’s lands, but such as were holden of him,
nor the other to give aid, or do service in regard of his whole property,
but in proportion to that only which he derived from his superior. Add to
this, that the lord, in consideration of the lands having been originally his,
retained a jurisdiction over all his tenants dwelling thereon, and in his court
sat in judgment, and determined their controversies. These striking diversities
(and many more there are) it is apprehended, will be sufficient to demonstrate
the impossibility of deriving the feudal customs from the <i>old</i> institution
of patron and client among the Romans.</p>

<p>Secondly, Others, sensible that military service was the first spring, and
the grand consideration of all feudal donations, have surmised, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
grants of forfeited lands by the dictators Sylla and Cæsar, and afterwards
by the triumvirs Octavius, Anthony and Lepidus, to their veterans, gave
the first rise to them<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. In answer to this, I observe, that those lands, when
once given, were of the nature of all other Roman estates, and as different
from fiefs, as the estates of clients, which we have already spoken of,
were. Besides, these were given as a reward for past services, to soldiers
worn out with toil, and unfit for farther warfare; whereas fiefs were given
at first gratuitously, and to vigorous warriors, to enable them to do future
military service.</p>

<p>Others have looked upon the emperor Alexander Severus<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> as the first
introducer of these tenures, because he had distributed lands on the borders
of the empire, which he had recovered from the Barbarians, among his
soldiers, on the condition of their defending them from the incursions of
the enemy; and had granted, likewise, that they might pass to their children,
provided they continued the same defence. This opinion, indeed,
is more plausible than any of the rest that derive their origin from the
Romans, as these lands were given in consideration of future military service;
yet, when we consider, on the one hand, that in no other instance
did these estates agree with fiefs, but had all the marks of Roman property;
and that, on the other hand, feudal grants were not, for many ages, descendible
to heirs, but ended, at farthest, with the life of the grantee, we shall
be obliged to allow this notion to be as untenable as any of the foregoing.</p>

<p>The surmise of some others, that the feudal tenancies were derived from
the Roman agents, bailiffs, usufructuaries, or farmers, is scarce worth confuting;
as these resembled only, and that very little, the lowest and most
improper feuds; and them not in their original state, when they were
precarious, but when, in imitation of the proper military fief, which certainly
was the original, they were become more permanent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, Some resort as far as Constantinople for the rise of fiefs, and
tell us that Constantine Porphyrogenetus was their founder; but he lived in
the tenth century, at a time that this law was already in France, Germany,
Italy, and Spain, where it had arrived very near its full perfection, and
was therefore undoubtedly his model: So that, tho’ we must acknowledge
him the first who introduced these tenures into the Roman empire, to find
their original, we must look back into earlier ages, and among another people.</p>

<p>The pretensions of the Romans having been considered, and set aside, it
follows, that this law must have taken its rise among the barbarous nations;
but from which of them particularly, remains to be inquired. Some, solicitous
for the honour of the antient Gauls, quote Cæsar’s account of their
manners; <i>eos qui opibus valebant multos habuisse devotos, quos secum ducerent in
bella, soldurios sua lingua nuncupatos; quorum hæc est conditio, ut omnibus in
vita commodis una cum his fruantur quorum se amicitiæ dediderint; si quid iis
per vim accidat, aut eundem casum una ferant aut sibi mortem consciscant</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>; in
these words they imagine they have plainly the mutual connection between
lords and vassals. The Spaniards too put in their claim for the antient
Celtiberians, of whom Plutarch, in his life of Sertorius and Valerius Maximus,
gives the same account that Cæsar doth of the antient Gauls; and
Sir Edward Coke, in his zeal for the common law of England, which,
although he did not know it, is certainly feudal, relying on fabulous historians,
carries its antiquity so far back as to the British kings of Geoffrey of
Monmouth. But one short and plain observation will fully dissipate such
vain conceits, namely, that, whatever were the original customs of the barbarous
nations, inhabiting Gaul, Spain, or Britain, they were, many ages
before the rise of this law, entirely annihilated and forgotten. Gaul, Spain,
and Britain, were, for centuries, Roman provinces, governed entirely by
Roman magistrates, according to the imperial laws. For the Romans were
particularly studious of introducing their dress, their language, their laws
and customs, among the conquered nations, as the surest, and most effectual
means of keeping them in subjection.</p>

<p>Hence, it appears, we must find the true original of this law among those
nations, that destroyed the Western Empire of the Romans; where we first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
perceive the traces of it, that is, among the Franks, Burgundians, Goths,
and Lombards<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. Of these the first and last have the greatest number of advocates;
and, whether out of jealousy to the French monarchy, or not, I
cannot determine, the majority declares for the Lombards. These different
opinions, however, may be easily adjusted, by distinguishing between the
<i>beneficiary law</i>, as I shall call it, while the grants were at will, or for years,
or at the utmost for life, and that which is more properly and strictly called
<i>feudal</i>, when they became transmissible to heirs, and were settled as inheritances.
As to the beneficiary law, no one of these nations can lay a better
claim to it than another, or with reason pretend that the rest formed their
plan upon its model; each of them independent of the other, having established
the same rules, or rules nearly the same; which were, in truth, no
more than the ancient customs of each nation, while they lived beyond the
Rhine, and were such as were common to all the different people of Germany.
But, as to the law and practice of feuds, when they became inheritances,
there can be little doubt but it was owing to the Franks. For the
books of the feudal law, written in Lombardy, acknowledge, that the Emperor
Conrad, who lived about the year 1024, was the first that allowed
fiefs to be descendible in Germany and Italy<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; whereas the kingdom of the
Lombards was destroyed by Charlemagne above two hundred years before;
and he it was who first established among his own Franks the succession of
fiefs, limiting it, indeed, only to one descent. His successors continued the
same practice, and, by slow degrees, this right of succession was extended
so, that by the time of Conrad, all the fiefs in France, great and small,
went in course of descent, by the concession of Hugh Capet, who made use
of that device, in order to sweeten his usurpation, and render it less disagreeable<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.
By this concession he, indeed, established his family on the
throne, but so much weakened the power of that crown, that it cost much
trouble, and the labour of several centuries, to regain the ground then
lost.</p>

<p>The opinion of the feudal law’s being derived from the Lombards seems
owing to this, that, in their country, those customs were first reduced into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
writing, and compiled in two books, about the year 1150, and have been
received as authority in France, Germany and Spain, and constantly quoted
as such. But then it should be considered, that the written law in these
books is, in each of those nations, especially in France, controuled by their
unwritten customs; which shews plainly, that they are received only as evidence
of their own old legal practices. For had they been taken in as a
new law, they would have been entirely received, and adopted in the
whole.</p>

<p>But if, in this point, I should be mistaken, and the Lombards were
really the first framers of the feudal law, yet I believe it will be allowed
more proper for the person who fills this chair to deduce the progress of it
through the Franks, from whom we certainly borrowed it, than to distract
the attention of his audience, by displaying the several minute variations of
this law, that happened as it was used in different nations. To the nation of
the Franks, therefore, I shall principally confine myself, and endeavour to
shew by what steps this system of customs was formed among them, and
how their constitution, the model of our own just after the conquest, arose;
and at the same time I shall be particularly attentive to those parts of it only
that prevailed in England, or may some way contribute to illustrate our
domestic institutions.</p>

<p>In order, then, to illustrate the original of the French constitution, and
of their beneficiary, and its successor the feudal law, it will be necessary to
enter into some details as to the manners of this people, while they continued
in Germany, and which they preserved for a considerable time after
they passed the Rhine; as also to mention some few particulars of their history
when settled in France, in order to shew the reasons of their original
customs, and the ends their policy aimed at, and how, by change of circumstances,
the preservation of that system required new regulations; how the
feudal law arose, and grew to that perfection, in which, for so many ages,
it flourished throughout Europe. As skilful naturalists discover in the seed
the rudiments of a future tree, so, in a few passages of Cæsar and Tacitus,
concerning the customs of the Germans, may be seen the old feudal law,
and all its original parts, in <i>embryo</i>; which, in process of time, by gradually
dilating and unfolding themselves, grew into a perfect and compleat body.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
It will be highly proper, therefore, for the clearer comprehension of what is
to follow, to dwell somewhat particularly upon, and to make ourselves acquainted
with, the manners and institutions of those people; and for this
purpose, perhaps, it will be sufficient to consider them under the several
following heads, viz. their general disposition and manners, the several ranks
and orders of persons among them, their form of government, and the nature
of their policy; their regulations touching property, their methods of
administering justice, and the nature of the punishments they inflicted on
criminals.</p>

<p>First, as to their manners and general disposition: Germany was at that
time a wild uncultivated country, divided into a great number of small
cantons, separated from each other by thick forests, or impassable morasses,
and inhabited by a rude and simple people, who lived either by the chace or
pasturage, and were always either in a state of open war, or a suspicious
peace with their neighbours: A circumstance that obliged every one of these
little states to esteem military virtue in the first place, and to train up all
their people, fit for that purpose, in the constant use of arms, and to keep
them perpetually in a state ready always for either offence, or defence<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>But since, in every number of men, however assembled, some there will
be, from the natural strength of their bodies, and courage of their minds,
more fit for soldiers, and others, from the contrary causes, better adapted
to the arts of peace; these nations were necessarily distributed into two
ranks; those in whom the strength of the society consisted, the freemen or
soldiers, who were, properly speaking, the only members of the community,
and whose sole employment was war, or (in the intervals of hostilities, what
Xenophon considers as its image) hunting; and an inferior order of people,
who were servants to them, and, in return for protection, supplied the warriors
with the necessaries of life, occupied the lands for them, and paid stipulated
rates of cattle, clothes, and sometimes corn, namely, where they
had learned the use of agriculture from the neighbouring Romans. I follow
Craig in calling them servants rather than slaves, as an expression much
more suitable to their condition; for they were not condemned to laborious
works, in the houses of the freemen, as the slaves of other nations were.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Among these simple people, the wives and children even of the greatest
among them, and the old men, unfit for the toils of war, were their only
domestics. The servants of the Germans lived apart, in houses of their own,
and when they had rendered to their lords the services due by agreement,
they were secured in the rest, as their own property; so that a servant among
these people, though meanly considered by the superior rank, was, in truth,
more a freeman than the generality of the Romans under their Emperors<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
It has been an antient observation, that servitude among the northern nations
hath always been more gentle and mild than among those that lay
more southerly: A difference, to be ascribed to the different manners of the
people, resulting partly from their climate, and partly from their way of
life. A plain and simple people, unacquainted with delicacies, were contented
with the plainest fair; which was easily supplied, without afflicting
their servants with heavy labour, and gave no room for envy and discontent
in the breasts of inferiors. And a nation that had always the sword in
their hands were too conscious of their own strength, to entertain any apprehensions
from those, who, from their unfitness for that profession, were
destined to other employments. All motives, therefore, to fear on the one
side, and to envy and discontent on the other, being removed, we need not
be surprized at the general humanity with which the servants were treated
in these northern regions. The putting them in chains was a thing exceedingly
rare, and the killing them, except in a sudden gust of passion (an accident
which frequently happened among the freemen themselves) was almost
unheard of. The only difference in that case was, that the death of a
servant was not looked upon as a public crime, he being no member of the
political society, and therefore was not punished. Such then was the mutual
affection and confidence of these two ranks in each other, that whenever
there was occasion, they made no scruple of arming such of their servants
as were capable, and, by making them soldiers, admitted them into
the number of freemen; and the hopes of such advancement, we may be
assured, was a strong inducement to those of the lower rank to behave in
their station with fidelity and integrity. Another cause of this great lenity
to their servants arose from a custom peculiar to the Germans, which ordained,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that insolvent debtors should be reduced to servitude, until, either
by his labour, the creditor was satisfied, or, as it frequently happened, the
debt was paid by the insolvent’s relations. It was, indeed, reputed dishonourable
for the creditor himself to retain his debtor in servitude; but then
he either sold him to the prince, or some other person.</p>

<p>Among so plain a people, perhaps it may be thought debts were rare,
and that few instances occurred of freemen’s being reduced to slavery; but
Tacitus assures us of the contrary<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. These people were possessed with the
rage of gaming to such a degree, that nothing was more common than to
see them, when all their property was lost, set their liberty itself at stake.
It was natural, therefore, to treat those with gentleness, who had been once
perhaps the most valuable members of the body politic, especially for them
who knew their own privileges depended on the uncertain caprices of the
same goddess Fortune, and that an unlucky throw might reduce them to-morrow
to the same low condition. I have been the more particular on
this head, in order to shew, that, even in their infancy, the feudal maxims
were more favourable to the natural liberty of mankind, than the laws and
customs of the southern and more polite nations, and were of such a spirit,
as when circumstances changed, would naturally expand, and extend that
blessing to the whole body of the people; as we find it at present in our
excellent constitution.</p>

<p>To return, therefore, to the freemen: We find no traces of any different
orders of men among them; but as no kind of government, however rude,
can subsist without some subordination, and as it was impossible for them all
to continue together in one body, it was found necessary, in order to disperse
them round the country, that they should be subdivided into lesser parties,
and to appoint to each a chief, the most eminent and capable among
them; who, when a district was assigned him, distributed that among his
followers; who again, after having retained what they esteemed sufficient for
their own purposes, assigned part of what they had so received to their servants.
And here, indeed, we see the first rude original of lords and vassals.
These lords were those, of whom Tacitus says, <i>De minoribus rebus principes
consultant</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. One of these lords, and to him a larger territory was assigned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
than to the others, was the head of the whole body politic, and honoured
with the title of king. He was the superior, who, at their general assemblies,
made the distribution already mentioned, and appointed the other
lords. And, besides his excelling the others in the enjoyment of a more
extensive district, and in having a greater number of vassals and servants,
he was remarkably distinguished from them in two particulars. His office
was for life, and, in some degree, hereditary; for, in every nation there
was one family, descended, it is to be presumed, from the first founder of
the state, or some ancient hero, which was the only family noble by birth
among them, and the members of which alone were capable of this high
station. Not that these kings succeeded in a lineal, or any other regular
course of descent; for Tacitus intimates sufficiently that they were elective,
when he says, <i>Reges ex nobilitate sumunt</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. And indeed any one who considers
attentively the circumstances of these people, always either ready to invade
their neighbours, or dreading invasions from them, will allow, that any
kind of a constant regular succession was inconsistent with their preservation.
They were necessitated to choose among the royal family a man in the flower
of youth, or, at least, in the vigour of life, who, by his valour and
wisdom, might prove the proper head of a nation always in a state of war.
This will appear beyond a doubt, if we examine the ancient practice
of all the kingdoms founded by the Germans. Look over the lists of their
kings in any one nation, and examine the degree of kindred in which they
stood related to each other, and you will find them all, indeed, of one family;
but you will, at the same time, see that scarce a third of them could
derive their kindred, by way of title or descent, from their immediate predecessor;
yet were they obeyed chearfully by their subjects, nor ever looked
upon in those days as usurpers, though several modern writers, possessed
with opinions of their own ages, since kingdoms are almost universally settled
in a regular course of descent, have been so liberal in bestowing that
title upon them.</p>

<p>Montesquieu allows this was the manner of succession in the second race
of the Franks, but insists that those of the first inherited lineally<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. But was
this so originally, when Clovis came to the crown, he who first united all
the Franks under one sovereign? We find six or seven independent kings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of the Salian Franks, every one of them Clovis’s near relations, and consequently
descended from a common ancestor, at no very great distance. He
thought not himself, nor his posterity, secure in the possession of the throne,
until he had totally extirpated every other branch, and reduced the royal family
to his single person. Then, indeed, there was no danger of a competition
upon his death. So far was the crown from descending to any determined
person, that the kingdom was divided among all his children; and, for
several descents, his bloody example was followed in one generation, and in
the next a new division took place; nor, in all this time, do we hear of any
other title set up, than what followed either from the will of the father, the
consent of the people, or the fortune of war; which, it is apprehended, is
sufficient to shew, that, in these early ages, there were no invariable rules
of succession settled among the Franks. Otherwise, how came the kingdom
to be divisible, and the right heir to be obliged to content himself
with a small portion of his supposed legal inheritance<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>?</p>

<p>In the next lecture I shall give an account of the companions of the prince
among the Germans, and finish what I have to observe of the constitution
of their governments, and of their laws and customs, unto the time of their
entering into the Roman empire.</p>

<p><i>The</i> companions <i>of a German prince—The constitution of a German kingdom—The
condition of property in Germany—The methods followed there
of distributing justice, and the nature of the punishments inflicted on criminals.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Before we can be fully acquainted with all the several constituent
parts of the German state, it will be necessary to form a just notion of
those who were called the companions of the king or prince; who, being
chosen out of the most robust and daring of the youth, and having attached
themselves particularly to the person of their sovereign, were his chief defence
in war, and the great support of his dignity in times of tranquillity.
A few words of Tacitus will set this institution of theirs in a clear light.
Speaking of their princes, he says, “This is their principal state, their chief
strength, to be at all times surrounded with a numerous band of chosen
young men, for ornament and glory in peace, for security and defence
in war; nor is it among his own people only, but also from the neighbouring
communities, that a prince reaps high honour, and great renown,
when he surpasses in the number and magnanimity of his followers;
for such are courted by embassies, and distinguished with presents,
and by the terror of their fame alone often dissipate wars. In the day of
battle, it is scandalous for the prince to be surpassed in feats of bravery,
scandalous to the followers to fail in matching the valour of the prince.
But it is infamy during life, and an indelible reproach to return alive from
a battle wherein their prince was slain. To preserve him, to defend
him, and to ascribe to his glory all their gallant actions, is the sum, and
most sacred part of their oath. For from the liberality of their prince
they demand and enjoy that war-horse of theirs, and that terrible javelin,
dyed in the blood of their enemies. In place of pay, they are supplied
with a daily table and repasts, though grossly prepared, yet very profuse.
For maintaining such liberality and munificence, a fund is furnished by
continual wars and plunder<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Here, then, are to be seen most plainly the rudiments of that feudal connection,
that afterwards subsisted between the king and all his military vassals,
and of the oath of fealty which the latter took to him. To his person, and
to aid him in all he undertook, his companions were bound, during his and
their lives, by the strictest ties; but as to other freemen, who lived apart in
their villages, the bonds of allegiance were much more loose. This rude
people had no notion of what almost every civilized nation hath laid down
as a maxim, that being born in, and protected by a society, creates a durable
obligation. They served, indeed, in consideration of the lands they
held, in all defensive wars; and in all offensive ones, which either were generally
approved of, or in which they chose particularly to engage themselves.
Nay, so great was the notion of particular independence among
these people, that they thought that all of the freemen or soldiers, except
the <i>comites</i>, who had by oath bound themselves to the person of the king for
life, were at liberty to engage in expeditions, that neither the king, nor the
majority of the nation consented to; and that under leaders of their own
choosing. For as, at their general meetings, war was necessarily the most
common subject of deliberation, if any one proposed an enterprize, all who
approved the motion were at liberty to undertake it; and if the king declined
commanding therein, they chose a general capable thereof; and
when, under his conduct, they had succeeded, they either returned, and
divided the spoil, and became subjects of their former king as before; or,
if they liked the country they had subdued better, settled there, and formed
a new kingdom, under their victorious leader. <i>Duces ex virtute sumunt</i>,
saith Tacitus; a practice hard to be accounted for among nations exposed
to continual danger, and which must be thereby frequently weakened,
on any other supposition, than that it was first introduced to disburthen a
narrow territory, overstocked with inhabitants. This effect, however, it
must have had, that their kings were rendered more martial, and obliged
equally by their glory and interest, to command in every expedition, that
was agreeable to any considerable number of their subjects.</p>

<p>From this custom Montesquieu very ingeniously conjectures, that the
Franks derived their right of conferring on their <i>mairs de palais</i> the power
of war, at a time, when, by the long continued slaughters of the royal family,
they were obliged to place the crown on the heads of minors, or of
princes as incapable as minors; a power that enabled them, by degrees, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
usurp the civil administration, and at length to transfer the title also of royalty
to a new race, in the person of Pepin<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the face of a German state. A king chosen for his illustrious
extraction, attended by a numerous body of chosen youth, attached
to his service in war by the strictest bonds of fidelity; a number of
freemen divided into villages, over each of which was an elective chief, engaged,
likewise, to military duty, but in a laxer manner; and under all
these were the servants, who occupied the greatest part of the land, and supplied
the freemen with the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>It is time now to attend a little to their domestic policy, and to inform
ourselves what were the rights of each of these orders in the time of peace.
The king, we are assured by Tacitus, was far from being absolute<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. He was
judge, indeed, among his own peculiar vassals, who lived on his demesne, as
the other chieftains were in their respective districts. He presided in their
general assemblies, and was the first who proposed matters for their deliberation.
His opinion had great weight, indeed, from his rank and dignity,
but his power was rather that of persuasion than of command. The royal
family was no otherwise distinguished from others, than as their personal
merit acquired influence, or their high birth and capability of succession engaged
respect. The companions of the prince were highly honoured for
their faithful attachment to him, and their valourous atchievements in war;
but, as to rights and privileges, were on the common footing of other freemen.
The only distinction was between the chieftains, or lords of the villages,
and the vassals who were under their jurisdiction. The chieftains
were judges in their respective districts; but, to prevent partiality, to each
of them were assigned an hundred persons, chosen among the populace, to
accompany and assist him, and to help him at once with their authority and
their counsel. And this institution was, in all probability, the original of
the jurisdiction of the <i>pares curiæ</i> in the feudal law. Another, and a very
great check on their chieftains, was their being elective, and consequently
amoveable every year, if their conduct was displeasing either to prince or
people. These elections, as well as those of their assessors, were made in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
their assemblies; where, indeed, every thing of any consequence was transacted,
and therefore they deserve to be particularly treated of.</p>

<p>These conventions, then, unless they were summoned on extraordinary
occasions, were regularly held once a month, on certain stated
days; but such was the impatience of this people of controul, or any regularity
of proceeding, that Tacitus observes, that frequently two or three
days were spent before they were all assembled. For in these meetings,
every freeman, that is, every soldier, had an equal voice. They appeared
all in arms, and silence was proclaimed by the priests, to whom
also it belonged to keep the assembly in order, and to punish all disturbers
of its regularity. The king in the first place was heard, next such of the
chiefs as had any thing to propose, and lastly others, according to their precedence
in age, nobility, military virtue, or eloquence. If the proposition
displeased, they rejected it by an inarticulate murmur. If it was pleasing,
they brandished their javelins; the most honourable manner of signifying
their consent being by the sound of their arms. But this approbation of the
general assemblies was not of itself sufficient to establish a resolution. As the
sudden determinations of large multitudes are frequently rash, and injudicious,
it was found necessary to have what they had so determined re-considered
by a select body, who should have a power of rejecting or confirming
them. For this purpose the chieftains were formed into a separate assembly,
who, in conjunction with the king, either disannulled, or ratified what had
been agreed to by the people at large<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p>Such then was the constitution of a German kingdom, a constitution so
nearly resembling our own at present, as at first view would tempt any one
to think the latter derived immediately from thence. Yet this was not
the case. With respect to the Saxon times, as far as we can judge from the
few lights remaining, the form of government seems very nearly to resemble
this account which Tacitus gives us; but, for two centuries, at least, after
the conquest, the English constitution wore a face purely feudal. The sub-vassals
had long lost the privilege of being members of the general assembly,
from causes that shall be hereafter attempted to be explained; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
whole legislative power was lodged in the king and his immediate vassals,
whose interests frequently clashing, and creating continual broils, it was
found necessary, for the advantage both of the sovereign and nobles, that a
proper balance should be formed. Accordingly, much at the same time in
France, Spain, and England, namely, in or about the thirteenth century,
the happy method of readmitting the third estate, by way of representation,
was found out, with an addition very favourable to the natural rights of
mankind, that traders and artizans, who before had been treated with the
most sovereign contempt, were now permitted to make part of the general
assembly, and put on an equal footing with other subjects<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>But to return to the assembly of German chieftains, or their house of
lords, as I may call it; besides a share in the legislative power, they were
likewise a council, to assist the king in the execution of the resolutions of
the general assembly, and determined solely by their own authority all matters
of lesser moment, that did not immediately affect the whole community.
<i>De minoribus rebus principes consultant, de majoribus omnes.</i></p>

<p>Many other things were likewise transacted in these general assemblies,
as particularly the admission of a new member into the political society.
When a youth was judged capable of bearing arms, he was introduced by
his relations into the assembly; and if they testified his capacity of wielding
them, he was dignified with a lance and javelin by one of the chieftains, or
by his father, or some other near relation. This was his <i>toga virilis</i>. Then,
and not before, was he emancipated from the family he belonged to, was
permitted to become a soldier, and in consequence admitted to all the privileges
of a free subject. A practice that, in after ages, gave rise to the solemn
and public manner of creating knights<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>This, likewise, was the proper place of accusing criminals of public
crimes, namely such as were looked upon by those people particularly to
affect the whole society; neither was it unusual, likewise, to bring hither accusations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
of private wrongs, if the party injured was apprehensive of partiality
in his own canton.</p>

<p>But the business of greatest moment, next to legislation, was, that, once in
a year, in these assemblies, each village, with the approbation of the king,
chose their chiefs, and their hundred assistants<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Here it was they either
received a testimony of their good behaviour, by being continued in office
another year, or saw themselves reduced to the rank of private subjects, if
their conduct had not been acceptable. At the same time were the lands
distributed to the several chieftains, which leads me to say something on the
next head, their regulations with respect to property; as to which their institutions
were very singular, and totally different from those of all ancient,
as well as modern nations.</p>

<p>All property being then naturally divisible into two kinds, moveable and
immoveable, of the first these people had but a scanty share, their whole
wealth consisting in their arms, a few mean utensils, and perhaps some cattle.
The use of gold and silver, in the way of commerce, was utterly unknown
to them, except to a few of their nations, namely such as lived near
the Rhine, and had acquired some by dealing with the neighbouring Gauls.
Consequently, there was no such thing as an accumulation of wealth among
them, or any great disparity in the distribution of this kind of property, over
which each had uncontrouled dominion during his life. But as testaments,
or last wills, were unknown amongst them, upon death, the right went according
to the plain dictates of nature. Tacitus saith, “To every man his
own children were heirs and successors. For want of them, his nearest
of kin, his own brothers, next his father’s brothers, or his mother’s.”
Whatever there was, was divided among the males next in degree; save that
to each of the females, a few arms were assigned, the only dowry in use
among those people; a dowry which, as Tacitus saith, signified that they
were to share with their husbands in all fortunes of life and death. Accordingly,
they constantly attended them to the field, were witnesses of their valour,
took care of the wounded<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; and often, if their party had the worst,
they ran into the ranks, and by their presence and danger, animated the
men to renew the charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>But with respect to real or landed property, the case was very different.
Here a man had only the use, or enjoyment of the profits; and that, too,
but a temporary one. The real property, or <i>dominium verum</i>, was lodged in
the community at large; and was, at the end of every year, cantoned out,
and distributed to the several tribes of the people; and the portion assigned
to each was after that subdivided to the respective individuals; who by
these means were perpetually removed from one part of the territory to another;
nor could any man tell in what place his lot was to fall the next
year<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. And this custom, absurd as it seems to us, they were so fond of,
as to continue for some time after they settled in the Roman territories; until,
growing by degrees acquainted with the conveniencies of life, a change
of manners was introduced, and they wished for more settled habitations.
Then came into use grants for terms of years, after for life, and lastly,
estates descendible to heirs, which are those we, properly speaking, called
<i>fiefs</i>. This continual removal of habitation, so intolerable to a people any
way accustomed to comfortable dwellings, was no manner of inconvenience
to them. Their little substance was easily removed, and two or three days
were sufficient to erect a sorry hovel, which contented the wishes of the
greatest among them<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. But their passion for this constant change of place
seems derived from that condition which I have already observed they were
in, namely, a middle state between hunters and shepherds; and that they
still retained that practice, was an evidence that they had not been long reclaimed
from a savage life. Tacitus indeed says, that, in the intervals of
war, they were not much employed in hunting, but lived a lazy and inactive
life. This, however, I apprehend, must be understood only of a few nations,
nearest to the Romans, where game was not so plentiful, and not of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
all the Germans in general: for it is certain the Franks had a strong passion
that way, after they were settled in Gaul; and from them the plan of the
forest laws, so justly complained of in England, after the conquest, was derived.
And true it is, that whole nations, as well as individuals, were possessed
with this rambling inclination; and that, not always with a view of
settling in a better country. If the Germans changed their barren wilds for
the warm sun and fertile climate of Gaul, we are assured by the same authority,
that many tribes of the Gauls, on the other hand, removed to the
forests of Germany. If Jornandes tells us, that the Goths quitted the bleak
and barren mountains of Scandinavia for the pleasant banks of the Danube,
he likewise informs us, that, afterwards, they returned back into their native
country.</p>

<p>As to their methods of administering justice, I have already observed, that
their chieftains, in the several districts, assisted by their assessors, were their
judges. Before them all causes were brought, which were not discussed in
their general assemblies; but as to the manner of investigating the truth, all
the German nations did not agree. Nay the Salian Franks differed considerably
from their brethren, the Ripuarian Franks. If the judge, or his
assessors, or any of them, had knowledge of the fact in dispute, which often
happened, as these people lived much in public, and in the open air, they
gave sentence on such their knowledge. This was common to them all;
but if there was no such knowledge in any of the <i>pares curiæ</i>, as I may call
them, and the fact in question was denied, the Salians proceeded thus:
The accuser or plaintiff produced his witnesses, the accused did the like;
and on comparing the evidence on both sides, the judges gave sentence. If
the plaintiff had no witnesses, the defendant, on his denial, was dismissed of
course. If the witnesses for the plaintiff failed in fully proving the point,
and yet their testimony was such, as induced a presumption which the other
party was not able to remove, the trial was referred to the ordeal<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. That
of boiling water was the most usual among them. The manner was thus:
The person suspected plunged his hand into the boiling water, which was
afterwards carefully closed up, and inspected at the end of three days: If no
sign of the scalding then appeared, he was acquitted; if otherwise, he was
esteemed guilty<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>It is strange that any people should, for ages, make use of such a method,
which a very little reflection, or common experience, might easily satisfy
them had no manner of connection with guilt or innocence. But, besides
the gross superstition of these nations, who thought the honour of providence
concerned in the detection and punishment of criminals, Montesquieu
hath given us another reason for this practice, which, whether just or not,
for its ingenuity, deserves to be taken notice of. He observes, that the military
profession naturally inspires its votaries with magnanimity, candour,
and sincerity, and with the utmost scorn for the arts of falshood and deceit.
This trial, then, he imagines calculated to discover plainly to the eye,
whether the person accused had spent his whole life in the arts of war, and
in the handling of arms. For if he had, his hands would thereby have acquired
such a callousness, as would prevent any impression from the boiling
water, discernible at that distance of time. He therefore was acquitted,
because it was presumed he would not screen himself by a falshood. But if
the marks appeared, it was plain he was an effeminate soldier, had resisted
the force of education, and the general bent of his countrymen; that he
was not to be moved by the spur of constant example, that he was deaf to
the call of honour; and consequently such a person whose denial could have
no weight to remove the presumption against him<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>These were the methods of trial among the Salians, but the Ripuarian
Franks, the Burgundians, and several other German nations acted very differently.
No witnesses were produced among them on either side, but they
contented themselves with what were called negative proofs; that is, the
person accused swore positively to his own innocence, and produced such a
number of his relations as the custom of the country required: or if he had
not relations enough, the number was made up out of his intimate acquaintance:
These were to swear that they believed his oath to be true, and upon
this he was acquitted. But if he declined the oath, or could not produce
a sufficient number of compurgators, he was found guilty; a practice
that fully proves these nations were, when this method was introduced, a
people of great simplicity and sincerity<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>But as, by this means, every profligate person, with the assistance of a
few others as wicked as himself, was sure to escape, the defects of this kind
of trial introduced another, or rather revived an antient one, no less inconclusive.
Antiently, the Germans had no judicatures for the decision of private
wrongs; but each in person took his own satisfaction, and this introduced
perpetual combats. When the new method of trial came in use, a
party seeing his adversary ready to defeat his just demands, and screen his
injustice with perjury, resorted to his antient right, refused to accept the
oath, and appealed to the providence of God by the trial of battle: a method
as absurd, indeed, as the former, but peculiarly adapted to the way
of thinking of the Germans, who frequently, before they entered into a
war, prognosticated the success of it from the event of a combat between
one of their own nation, and a captive of the enemy<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. This kind of trial
gained ground among all the defendants of this ferocious people<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, and
introduced itself at length among the Salians, who had it not at first, and
who, by admitting positive proofs, had no need of it; and, though long
fallen into disuse, hath left behind, its offspring, private duelling. It hath
been long since observed, that this fashionable custom owed its origin to
these northern nations, the ancestors of the present inhabitants of Europe,
as no other nations, antient or modern, however martial or disposed to war,
had any knowledge or practice of it; but it is undeniably evinced by this,
that as a lie, above all other provocations, is the strongest, and what lays
gentlemen of honour under an indispensible necessity of duelling, so were
<i>you lie</i> the very words mutually given and received in old times, the accustomed
form of joining issue by battle, after which neither party, without
perpetual infamy and degradation from his rank, could recede.</p>

<p>I have taken the more notice of these four different methods of trial
among the old Germans, as every one of them has been received into England.
Concerning the first, the trial by witnesses, little need be said. As
it is the fairest, and the justest, it has accordingly, pursuant to the practice
of all civilized nations, prevailed over all the rest; and it is that, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
that only, that we use at this day. But the ordeal also was in use among
the Saxons, and continued some time after the Norman conquest; as appears,
not only by the old records of the law, but from the famous story,
whether true or false, of queen Emma, mother of Edward the Confessor,
and the plow-shares<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. The trial by negative proofs, though out of practice,
is still in being, in what is called by us the <i>wager of law</i>; where, if a
person is impleaded in an action of debt, on a simple contract, he may clear
himself, by swearing he oweth it not, and by producing eleven others, who
swear to their belief that he has deposed the truth<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Hence it has happened,
that, for a long time past, <i>actions of debt</i>, in such cases, have not
been brought, but another, called an <i>action on the case</i>, is the usual method,
which admits the parties on both sides, as to the point of debt, <i>vel non debet</i>
to an examination of witnesses. For the last, the trial by battle, our old
books are full of it, in real actions; and although, to prevent the inconvenience
and uncertainty of it, the grand assize was invented; yet was it in
the tenant’s, that is, the defendant’s option, to choose which method of trial
he pleased. The latest instance of joining issue by battle, I have met with,
is in Dyer’s Reports, in the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; but by this
time it was so much discouraged, that, by force of repeated adjournments,
the parties were prevailed on to agree, and judgment was at length given
upon the failure of one of the parties appearing on the day appointed for
the combat.</p>

<p>When the truth, by some of the methods above-mentioned, was ascertained,
judgment was to be given. Here it will be proper to observe, that,
among these people, there were only two kinds of crimes, that were looked
upon as public ones, and consequently capital. The first was treason,
or desertion in the field, the punishment hanging; the second cowardice, or
unlawful lust, for they were strict observers of the nuptial band, the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
stifling in a morass, with an hurdle over them. It seems, at first view,
surprising, that murder, which Tacitus assures us, from sudden gusts of passion,
and intemperance in liquor, was very frequent, should not, as it so
much weakened the strength of the nation, be considered as a criminal offence,
and punished accordingly<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. But a little reflection on their situation
will reconcile us to it. The person slain was already lost to the society, and
if every murder was a capital offence, the state would lose many of its
members, who were its chief supporters. Besides, if the slayer had no
hopes of mercy, nothing else could be expected than his desertion to their
enemies, to whom he could be of infinite service, and to them of infinite
detriment, from his knowledge of their strength and circumstances, and of
the passes into their country, through the morasses and forests, which were
their chief defence. Murder, therefore, like other lesser crimes, was
atoned among those people, as it was among the ancient Greeks, who were
in pretty similar circumstances, in the heroic times, as Ajax assures us in
these words, in the ninth Iliad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">και μεν τις τε κασιγνητοιο φονοιο</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ποινεν, η του παιδος εδεζατο τεθνειωτος,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">namely, by a satisfaction of cattle, corn, or money, to the persons injured,
that is, to the next of kin to the deceased, with a fine to the king or lord,
as an acknowledgment of his offence, and to engage the society to protect
him against the future attempts of the party offended. These satisfactions
were not regulated originally, nor fixed at any certain rate, but left to the
discretion of the injured, or next of kin. However, if he appeared extraordinarily
unreasonable, and refused what was judged competent, the society,
upon payment of his fine to their head, took the offender into protection,
and warranted his security against the attempts of the other party, or
his friends. After these nations were settled in the Roman empire, these
satisfactions for each offence were reduced to a certainty by their laws<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<p>This is as much as I have thought necessary to observe at present, concerning
the manners and customs of these people, while they remained beyond
the Rhine. It will next be proper to see how far afterwards they retained
them, and what alterations were introduced by their new situation.</p>

<p>It is full time now to quit the wilds of Germany, to attend these nations
in their passage into the Roman dominions, and to take a view of the
manner wherein they settled themselves in these new countries. The Roman
empire had been long on the decline; but especially, from the time of Severus,
it every day grew weaker. This weakness arose, in a great measure,
from an excessive luxury, which disqualified not only their great ones,
but the bulk of the Roman people for soldiers; and also from the tyrannical
jealousy of their emperors, who were afraid of trusting persons of virtue or
ability, and had no other method of supporting their authority, than by employing
numerous standing armies, that, under them, pillaged and oppressed
the defenceless populace; and lastly, from the licentiousness of the soldiery,
who made and unmade emperors according to their wild caprices.
Hence proceeded many competitions for that dignity, and continual battles
and slaughters of their men at arms; the natural consequence of which was,
that whoever prevailed in these bloody contests, always found himself less
able and powerful to defend the empire from foreign enemies or domestic
competitors, than his predecessor was<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p>About the year 200 after Christ, the several nations who had been hitherto
cooped up beyond the Rhine and the Danube, and kept in some awe
by the terror of the Roman name, began to gather some courage from the
weakness of the empire; and from that time few years passed without incursions
into, and ravages of, some part of the southern territories, by one
or other of these people; and how redoubtable they became to that decaying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
state, may easily be judged from the particular fondness the emperors
of those days had, upon every slight advantage gained over them, for assuming
the pompous titles of Gothicus, Vandalicus, Alemannicus, Francicus,
&amp;c. not for the conquest, or reducing into subjection those several people,
as in antient times, but merely for having checked them, and kept them out
of the Roman boundaries<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.</p>

<p>But these invasions of the northern nations were a long time confined to
the single views of rapine and plunder; for as yet they were not fully convinced
of their own strength, and the enfeebled condition of their enemies.
And perhaps they might have longer continued in this ignorance, and
within their former bounds, had it not been for an event that happened about
the year 370, the like to which hath several times since changed the face of
Asia. I mean a vast irruption of the Hunns, and other Tartarian nations
into the north of Europe. These people, whether out of their natural desire
of rambling, or pressed by a more potent enemy, were determined on a
general change of habitation; and, finding the invasion of the Persian empire,
which then was in its full grandeur, an enterprize too difficult, they
crossed the Tanais, and obliged the Alans and Goths, who lived about the
Borysthenes and the Danube, to seek new quarters. The former fled westward
to Germany, already overloaded with inhabitants; and the latter begged
an asylum from Valens in the eastern empire, which was willingly accorded
them. The countries south of the Danube were before almost entirely
depopulated by their frequent ravages. Here, therefore, they were
permitted to settle, on the condition of embracing the Christian faith; and
it was hoped they, in time, would have proved a formidable barrier against
the incroaching Hunns, and, by a conformity of religion, be at length
melted into one people with the Romans. For the attaining this purpose,
they were employed in the armies, where, to their native fierceness and
bravery, they added some knowledge of discipline, the only thing they
wanted; and many of their kings and great men were in favour at court,
and either supported by pensions, or raised to employments in the state<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>But the injudiciousness of this policy too soon appeared; and indeed it
was not to be expected that a people used entirely to war and rapine, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
unaccustomed to any other method of subsistance, could in a short time be
reduced to the arts of social life, and to the tillage of the earth; or be retained
in any moderate bounds, in time of peace, when, by being admitted within
the empire, they saw with their own eyes the immense plunder that lay before
them, and the inability of the Romans to oppose their becoming masters
of it. During the life of Theodosius they remained in perfect quiet, awed
by his power and reputation; but when he left two weak minor princes under
the guardianship of two interested and odious regents, it was obvious
they could not be bridled much longer. Though, if we are to credit the
Roman historians, their first irruption was owning to the jealousy Ruffinus,
the prime minister of Arcadius, entertained of Stilicho, the guardian of Honorius.
This latter, it is said, ambitious of holding the reins of both empires,
pretended, that Theodosius had on his death-bed appointed him sole
regent of both. For, though Arcadius was now of sufficient age to govern
of himself, he was, in truth, for want of capacity, all his life a minor. Ruffinus,
we are told, conscious of his rival Stilicho’s superior talents and
power, resolved to sacrifice his master’s interest rather than submit to one he
so much hated; and, accordingly, by his private emissaries, stirred up both
Goths and Hunns, to fall at once on the eastern empire<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 406, these nations, so long irreconcileable enemies to each other,
poured their swarms in concert into the defenceless dominions of Arcadius.
The Hunns passed by the Caspian sea, and with unrelenting cruelty
ravaged all Asia to the gates of Antioch; and at the same time the Goths,
under the so much dreaded Alarick, with no less fury, committed the like
devastations in Illyricum, Macedon, Greece, and Peneloponnesus. Stilicho,
thinking that his saving the eastern empire would undoubtedly accomplish for
him his long wished-for desire of governing it in the name of Arcadius, as
he did the western in that of Honorius, hastened into Greece with a well-appointed
army. But, when he had the barbarous enemy cooped up, and, as
it were, at his mercy, the weak prince, instigated by his treacherous minister
Ruffinus, sent him orders to retire out of his dominions. The Goths returned
unmolested to the banks of the Danube, laden with plunder; and
Stilicho went bank to Italy boiling with rage and resentment, but he never
had an opportunity of wreaking his vengeance on his treacherous rival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>In the next year, Germany, surcharged with her own inhabitants, and the
nations who fled from the Hunns, and, perhaps, instigated by Ruffinus, to
find work for Stilicho at home, sent forth her multitudes across the Rhine;
and, for three successive years, the Suevians, Alans, Vandals, and Burgundians,
laid all the open country of Gaul waste; and, about the same
time, Constantine, a Roman Briton, assumed the imperial purple, and was
acknowledged by all the Romans of that island and Gaul.</p>

<p>The western empire was now utterly disqualified for defence: Stilicho,
the only man whose abilities and influence were capable of saving the falling
state, had been suspected of treason in aspiring to the diadem, and was put
to death; and Alarick, having before effectually plundered Greece, was
now acting the same part in Italy, while Honorius, shut up in Ravenna,
made but feeble efforts of resistance. Twice was Rome besieged, once redeemed
by an immense ransom, and the second time taken, plundered and
burnt. At length these calamities a little subsided; Constantine, the British
usurper of the empire, died; and all the western Romans again acknowledged
Honorius; but the western empire, though she lingered some time,
had received her mortal wound, and utterly perished in less than fifty years.
The distressed emperor Honorius granted to the Burgundians, who were
the most civilized of these barbarians, and had embraced the Christian religion,
the country they had possessed themselves of, namely, Alsace and
Burgundy. The Goths, who were already Christians, but of the Arian
persuasion, having by this time exhausted Italy, were easily prevailed on,
under Ataulphus, Alarick’s successor, to settle in the south-west of Gaul,
under a like grant; which country had been quitted in the year 410 by the
Sueves, Alans, and Vandals, who had over-run all Spain, and divided it
into three kingdoms. And thus were two kingdoms formed in the south
of Gaul, the new inhabitants of which coming by compact, and under the
title of the Roman emperor, behaved afterwards to the subjected Romans
and Gauls not in the light of brutal conquerors. Though they themselves
retained their own customs, they indulged these in the use of the Roman
laws, suffered them to enjoy a considerable portion of the lands, and made
no very afflicting distinctions between themselves and their subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>The Burgundians, particularly, we are informed, took two thirds of the
lands, the pasturage and forests, with one third of the slaves to look after
their flocks, and left the remainder to the Romans, who were skilled in
agriculture. They also quartered themselves in the houses of the Romans,
which naturally produced an acquaintance and amity between the two nations.
But one great reason, as I apprehend, of the lenity of these people
to the vanished (and a similar one will account for the Ostrogoths and
Lombards in Italy, afterwards, following their example, which likewise
hath been taken notice of with wonder by some authors) was their neighbourhood
to the Roman empire, which still continued in name in the west,
and which they might well be afraid of seeing revived, under a prince of
ability, if their harsh treatment alienated the conquered people’s affections
from them<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>But different was the treatment the conquered met with from the Franks,
who about this same time settled themselves at a greater distance from Italy,
namely, in Belgic Gaul. The Franks, above most of the other German nations,
had been for a considerable time attached to the Romans, insomuch
that if they did not receive their kings from them, as Claudian tells us they
did from Honorius, at least the kings received their confirmation from the
emperors; and they continued in this fidelity till the year 407, when they
fought a bloody battle with the Sueves, Vandals, and Alans, to prevent their
passing the Rhine, to invade the Roman territories. But when they found
the western empire already dismembered, they thought it not convenient
to lie still, and suffer other nations to share the prey entirely amongst themselves.
The Salians, therefore, took possession of the present Netherlands,
and the Ripuarians to their original country of Mentz and Hesse, added
Treves, Cologne, and Lorrain. Some have thought these people had grants
from the Roman emperor, in the same manner as I have mentioned before
concerning the Burgundians and Visigoths; but I should, with others, apprehend
this to be a mistake; for Ætius the Roman general left the Goths
and Burgundians in quiet possession of their seats, but defeated, and obliged
the Franks to repass the Rhine, which made them, after the danger was over,
return with double fury; and for a long time after they treated the conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Romans in the stile of masters, and with many afflictive distinctions,
unknown to their neighbours the Goths and Burgundians<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>Many, in the first heat of victory, they reduced to slavery, to a servitude
very different from what had been before practised in Germany, and nearly
approaching to what was used by the Romans. For whatever property was
acquired by these slaves or servants, who in after ages were called Villains,
belonged to their masters, not absolutely, as at Rome; but the masters
claimed and took possession of it, and they (I mean in France) for the enjoyment
of what was permitted them, paid a stipulated tax called <i>census</i>,
which was the only tax used there in those ancient times. However, they
did not employ them in domestic drudgery, but suffered them to live apart,
as the proper German servants had done. Their duties were uncertain, in
this agreeing with those of the men of war, and differing from those of
the middle rank, which I shall hereafter mention, and were of the most
humiliating kind, they being obliged to attend at their lord’s summons, to
carry out dung, remove nuisances, and do other mean and servile offices.
The number of these slaves and villains for centuries perpetually increased,
from the many wars both foreign and civil, these people were engaged in,
and the <i>jus gentium</i> of those ages, by which all that were taken in war were
reduced to slavery; insomuch that, by the year 1000, the number of these
villains was immense, whole cities and regions being reduced to that state<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>This introduction of a new order of men, unknown to the original German
policy, and inferior to all others, was of advantage to that which had
before been the lowest, I mean the <i>servants</i>, as they were called in Germany,
or <i>socage tenants</i>, as they were called in England; for the duties they paid
their lords were fixed at a certain rate, which being performed, they were
chargeable with no other burdens, and, though no members of the body
politic, as having no share in the public deliberations, either in person or
by representation, were in reality free men. These, with the addition of
several of the captive Romans, who were most skilful in agriculture, were
the successors of the old servants in Germany; but their numbers, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the causes before-mentioned, the perpetual wars, continually decreased,
great multitudes of them being reduced into the state of villainage<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p>The soldiers, who were really what composed the nation, continued for
a longer time pretty much in the same state as in Germany; for a whole
people do not part with their accustomed usages and practices on a sudden.
They changed their habitations as before, their manner of judicature and administering
justice continued the same, they met in general assemblies as
usual, but, as they were now dispersed over a more extensive country, not
so frequently as formerly. When they were converted to Christianity,
which happened under Clovis, who, by uniting all the Franks, subduing
the Alemans, and conquering considerable tracts of country from both the
Visigoths and Burgundians, first formed a considerable kingdom, it was
found exceedingly inconvenient to assemble every month. Thrice in the
year, namely on the three festivals, was found sufficient, except on extraordinary
occasions; and this method was continued many ages in France and in
England. For hundreds of years after the conquest, these were the most
usual and regular times of assembling parliaments.</p>

<p>But though things, in general, wore the same face as when these people
remained at home, it will be necessary to observe, that a change was insensibly
introducing, the king and the chieftains were daily increasing their
privileges, at the expence of the common soldiers, an event partly to be
ascribed to the general assemblies being less frequent, and consequently
fewer opportunities occurring for the people at large to exert their power;
but principally to the many years they had spent successively in camp, before
they thought themselves secure enough to disperse through the country.
The strictness of military discipline, and that prompt and unlimited obedience
its laws require, habituated them to a more implicit submission to
their leaders, who, from the necessities of war, were generally continued
in command. And it is no wonder that while the authority of the inferior
lords was thus every day gaining strength, that of the king should encrease
more considerably. For, probably, because he, as general, was the fittest
person to distribute the conquered lands to each according to his merits,
he about this time assumed to himself, and was quietly allowed the entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
power of the partition of lands. They were still, and for some considerable
time longer, assigned in the general assemblies, but according to his sole
will and pleasure, to the several lords, who afterwards subdivided them to
their followers in the same manner at their discretion; whence it came, that
these grants were called benefices, and are constantly described by the old
writers, as flowing from the pure bounty and benevolence of the lord<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>A power so extraordinary in a king would tempt any one, at first view;
to think that he who had so unlimited a dominion over the landed property,
must be a most absolute monarch, and subject to no manner of controul
whatsoever. It will therefore be proper to make an observation or two, to
shew why, in fact, it was otherwise. First, then, the ascendant the lords
had gained over their followers, made it extremely dangerous for the king
to oppress the lords, lest it might occasion, if not a rebellion, at least a
desertion of them and their people. For the bonds of allegiance, except
among the companions of the king, as I observed before, were not yet fully
tied. On the other hand, the interest of the lords obliged them to protect
their inferiors from the regal power. Secondly, this power of the king,
and of his lords under him, was not unlimited in those times, as it may
appear to be at first sight, and as it became afterwards. For, though he
could assign what land he pleased to any of the Franks, he could not assign
any part to any other but a Frank, nor leave any one of the Franks unprovided
of a sufficient portion, unless his behaviour had notoriously disqualified
him<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p>But the strongest reason against this absolute power in those times, is to
be drawn from the common feelings of human nature. As absolute monarchies
are only to be supported by standing armies, so is an absolute unlimited
power over that army, who have constantly the sword in their hands,
a thing in itself impossible. The Grand Seignior is, indeed, the uncontrouled
lord of the bulk of his subjects, that is, of the unarmed; but let him
touch the meanest of the janizaries, in a point of common interest, and he
will find that neither the sacredness of the blood of Ottoman, nor the religious
doctrine of passive obedience, can secure his throne. How then could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
an elective prince, in these northern regions, exercise an uncontrouled dominion
over a fierce people, bred up in the highest notions of civil liberty and
equality? One of their old maxims they long religiously adhered to, that
is, that, in consideration of their lands, they were bound to serve only in
defensive wars; so that a king who had engaged in an offensive one, had
every campaign a new army to raise by the dint of largesses; which if he
had no treasure left him by his predecessor, as he frequently had, and which
every king by all means was diligent in amassing, he supplied from the
profits of his demesns, the <i>census</i> on his villains, or else from foreign
plunder<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>But these people had not long been settled in their new seats, before the
encrease of their wealth, and the comfortableness of their habitations, rendered
a constant removal inconvenient, and made them desirous of more
settled assurance in their residence, than that of barely one year. Hence
it came, that many were, by the tacit permission of the king, or the lord,
allowed to hold after their term was expired, and to become what our
law calls <i>tenants by sufferance</i>, amoveable at any time, at the pleasure of
the superior; and afterwards, to remedy the uncertainty of these tenures,
grants for more years than one, but generally for a very short term, were
introduced. The books of the feudal law, written many hundred years
after, indeed, say that the first grants were at will, then for one year, then
for more; but I own I cannot bring myself to believe that these conquerors,
who were accustomed in Germany to yearly grants, could be satisfied with
a tenure so precarious as under that of a year, in their new acquisitions.
These grants at will, therefore, which are mentioned in those books, I understand
to be after their term ended. I mean this only as to the warrior-Franks,
for as to the socagers and villains, I will readily allow that many of
the former, and all the latter, were originally at pleasure<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>About this period, as I gather from the reason and circumstances of the
times, was introduced the tenure of castleguard, which was the assignment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of a castle, with a tract of country adjacent, on condition of defending it
from enemies and rebels. This tenure continued longer in its original state
than any other; for by the feudal law it could be granted for no more than
one year certain<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>It is time now to take notice of such of the Romans as lived among the
Franks, and by them were not reduced to slavery. Clovis began his conquests
with reducing Soissons, where a Roman general had set himself up
with the title of a king; and after he had extended his conquests over all
the other states, the Franks, and some other German nations, the Armorici,
the inhabitants of Brittany, who, cut off from the body of the empire, had
for some time formed a separate state, submitted to him on condition of retaining
their estates, and the Roman laws. Their example was soon followed
by others. The Gauls who dwelt on the Loire, and the Roman garrisons
there, were taken into his service. Thus was the king of France sovereign
of two distinct nations, inhabiting the same country, and governed by
different laws. The Franks were ruled by their customs, which Clovis and
his successors reduced into writing; the Romans by the Imperial law. The
estates of the one were beneficiary and temporary; those of the others
were held <i>pleno jure</i> and perpetual, and now, or soon after, began to be
called <i>allodial</i>. But these allodial estates were not peculiar in after times to
the Romans; for as these estates were alienable, many of them were purchased
by the Franks: So that we read, that when Sunigisila and Callamon
were deprived of the benefices they held as Franks, they were permitted to
enjoy their estates in propriety. As the Romans were, before their submission,
divided into three classes, the nobles, the freemen, and the slaves, so
they continued thus divided; the nobles being dignified with the title of
<i>convivæ regis</i><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>But as it was unsafe to trust the government of these new subjects in the
hands of one of their nation, the king appointed annually one of his companions,
or <i>comites</i>, for that purpose, in a certain district; and this was the
origin of counties, and counts. The business of these lords was to take care
of, and account for the profits of the king’s demesns, to administer justice,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and account for the profits of the courts; which were very considerable, as
the Roman laws about crimes being, by degrees, superseded, and consequently
capital punishment in most cases abolished, all offences became
fineable, a third of which they retained to themselves. They also, in imitation
of the lords of the Franks, led their followers to the wars. For every
free Roman, that held four manors, was obliged to serve under his count;
and those that had more or less contributed in proportion. This military
duty, together with an obligation of furnishing the king with carriages and
waggons, was all the burden put upon them, instead of those heavy taxes
and imposts they had paid to their emperors; so that, in this instance, their
situation was much mended, though in other respects it was sufficiently mortifying<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.
The greatest among them was no member of the political body,
and incapable of the lowest office in the state; and as all offences were now
fineable, those committed against a Frank, or other Barbarian, were estimated
at double to the compensation of those committed against a Roman
or Gaul. No wonder, then, that <i>gentilis homo</i>, a term formerly of reproach
among the Romans, (for it signified a heathen and barbarian)
became now a name of honour, and a mark of nobility; and that the Romans
earnestly longed to turn their allodial estates into benefices, and to quit
their own law for the Salic. And when once they had obtained that privilege,
the Roman law insensibly disappeared, in the territories of the Franks,
the northern parts of modern France, which are still called the <i>païs des coutumes</i>;
whereas, in the southern parts, where no such odious distinctions
were made by the original conqueror, the Roman law kept its ground, and
is to this day almost entirely observed. These countries are called by the
French lawyers <i>païs de loi ecrite</i>, meaning the Roman<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<p>But we cannot have a compleat idea of the constitution of this nation,
without taking notice of the clergy, who now made a considerable figure
among them. Churchmen had, ever since the conversion of Constantine,
been of great consequence in the empire; but the influence they obtained
among the northern barbarians was much more extensive than what they
had in the Roman empire. The conversion of Clovis to the Christian religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
was owing to the earnest persuasions of his wife Clotildis, a zealous
Christian, and to a vow he made when pressed in battle, of embracing the
faith of Jesus Christ, if he obtained the victory. He and his people in general
accordingly turned Christians; and the respect and superstitious regard
they had in former times paid to their pagan priests, were now transferred
to their new instructors. The principal, therefore, of them were
admitted members of their general assemblies; where their advice and
votes had the greatest weight, as well as in the court of the prince; as
learning, or even an ability to read, was a matter of astonishment to such an
illiterate people, and it was natural in such a state they should take those in
a great measure as guides in their temporal affairs, whom they looked on as
their conductors to eternal happiness. As they were the only Romans (for
the churchmen were all of that nation) that were admissible into honours,
the most considerable of their countrymen were fond of entering into this
profession, and added a new weight to it. But if the sacredness of their
function gave them great influence, their wealth and riches added not a little
to it. Before the irruptions of the barbarians, they had received large
possessions from the bounty of the Roman emperors, and the piety of particulars.
These they were sure to possess: but their subsequent acquisitions
were much greater. Though these kings and their people had imbibed
the faith of Christ, they were little disposed to follow its moral precepts.
Montesquieu observes the Franks bore with their kings of the first race,
who were a set of brutal murderers, because these Franks were murderers
themselves. They were not ignorant of the deformity of their crimes, but,
instead of amending their lives, they chose rather to make atonement for
their offences, by largesses to their clergy. Hence the more wicked the
people, the more that order encreased in wealth and power<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p>But, to do justice to the clergy of that age, there was another cause of
their aggrandizement, that was more to their honour. As these barbarians
were constantly at war, and reduced their unhappy captives to a state of
slavery, and often had many more than they knew what to do with, it was
usual for the churchmen to redeem them. These, then, became their servants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and tenants, where they met not only with a more easy servitude,
but were, from the sacredness of the church, both for themselves and their
posterity, secured from any future dangers of the same kind. It was usual
also for the unhappy Romans, who were possessed of allodial estates, and saw
themselves in danger, by these perpetual wars, of not only losing them, but
their liberty also, to make over their estates to the church, and become its
socage-tenants, on stipulated terms, in order to enjoy the immunities
thereof.</p>

<p>By all these means the landed estates of the clergy grew so great, that in
time the military power of the kingdom was much enfeebled: for though
they were obliged to furnish men for the wars, according as the lands they
held were liable to that service, this was performed with such backwardness
and insufficiency, that the state at one time was near overturned, and it became
necessary to provide a remedy. Charles Martel, therefore, after having
delivered the nation from the imminent danger of the Saracen invasion,
found himself strong enough to attempt it. He stripped the clergy of almost
all their possessions, and, turning them into strict military tenures, divided
them among the companions of his victories; and the clergy, instead
of lands, were henceforth supported by tithes, which before, though sometimes
in use, were only voluntary donations, or the custom of particular
places not established by law<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p>In my next lecture I shall consider the introduction of estates for life into
the feudal system, and take notice of the consequences that followed from
thence.</p>

<p><i>The introduction of estates for life into the feudal system—The nature and forms
of investiture—The oath of fealty, and the obligations of lord and tenant.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In the preceding lecture I took notice of the different condition and situation
of the Romans and barbarians in the infancy of the French monarchy;
but it will be necessary to observe, that all the barbarians themselves
were not subject to the same laws and regulations. When the Ripuarian
Franks, after the murder of their sovereign, submitted to Clovis, it was
under an express condition of preserving their own usages. The same
privilege he allowed to the Allemans, whom he conquered, and to such
parts of the Burgundian and Gothic kingdoms as he reduced to his obedience.
The customs of all these several people, as they were Germans,
were indeed of the same spirit, and did pretty much agree; but in particular
points, and especially as to the administration of justice, they had many
variations; and these the several nations were fond of and studious of preserving.
What was peculiar to these people, above all other nations, was
this, that these different laws were not local, but personal: for although the
Salians, in general, dwelt in one part of the country, the Ripuarians in
another, the Allemans in a third, &amp;c. yet the laws were not confined to
these districts: but a Salian, in the Ripuarian territories was still judged by
his own, the Salian law; and the same was true of all the others. Another
peculiarity was, that the barbarians were not confined to live in the law they
were born under. The Romans, indeed, could not pass from their Roman
law to that of any one of their conquerors, until they were allowed, several
ages after, to acquire fiefs; but any of the barbarians, if he liked another
law better than his own, could adopt it: a privilege, I presume, derived
from that antient practice which they used, of removing from one state or
commonwealth to another, or of going forth to form a new one.</p>

<p>In the French monarchy, then, there were five different nations, besides
the Romans, governed by five distinct laws; but these five people, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
all of the same northern original, and descended from the conquerors of
Gaul, were, in the state, every one of them esteemed and regarded on an
equal footing, enjoyed the same privileges, and equally received benefices
from the king or other lords. I have already observed, that the bonds between
the king and his companions in Germany continued during their
joint lives. It had the same duration after they settled in Gaul; where they
either presided with him in his court, as they had done formerly, or were
settled in benefices near him, and in such situations as they might readily attend
him on occasion; or else were the governors and leaders of the free
Romans, under the title of counts. But all the grants of lands or offices
that they enjoyed were, as yet, but temporary. So that they were <i>fideles</i>,
or vassals, bound by an oath of fealty for life; but there were no fiefs, or
feudal tenures, if we may call them by that name, that continued for so
long a term<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>The introduction of beneficiary grants for life, as is very properly conjectured,
was first owing to the counts. They had, as I mentioned before,
the third part of the profits of the courts in their respective districts, which
made their office not only considerable and honourable, but opulent. They
lived apart from the other barbarians among the Romans, whose allodial
property was fixed and permanent. It was natural for them to wish the continuance
of their lucrative employments, and to make them as perpetual as
their obligation of fidelity was; and this they were enabled to attain by the
means of the profits they made of their places, and the want of treasure,
which the kings frequently laboured under to support their wars: for offensive
ones they could carry on in no other manner than by ready treasure.
The counts, therefore, by the dint of presents, or fines, attained, or I may
rather say, purchased estates for life in their offices; but these estates had,
at first, continuance only during the joint lives of the granter and grantee<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>But the matter did not stop here. The example was quickly followed
by the other barbarians, who were the immediate tenants of the crown,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and who now were growing weary of the constant, or even a frequent
change of habitation. And, in one respect, this allowance was of considerable
advantage to the king, as it created a tie upon them, equally durable
with that by which his companions were bound to him, and wore out by degrees
that principle they had before retained, that by throwing up what they
held from him, they were absolved from their allegiance. They, therefore,
as well as the companions, took the oath of fealty; which, as far as I can
find, was taken by none on the continent, whose estates were less than for
life; though, in the law of England, it is a maxim, that fealty is incident
to every tenure but two, namely, estates at will (for they did not think it
reasonable that a person should bind himself by oath, in consideration of
what might be taken from him the next day) and estates given in frank
almoigne, or free alms, that is, to religious houses, in consideration of saying
divine service, and praying for the donor and his heirs; and these were
excused out of respect to the churchmen, who were supposed not to need the
bond of an oath, to perform that duty to which they had dedicated themselves,
and also because the service was not done to the lord, who gave the
land, but to God.</p>

<p>Thus estates for life, created by particular grants, went on continually encreasing
in number, till the year 600, by which time almost every military
tenure, castle-guard excepted, was of this nature. And this accounts for
the particular regard the feudal, and from it our law shews to the tenant of
the freehold, and the preference given to him above a tenant for years.
For, first, his estate was, generally, more valuable and permanent, as long
terms were then unknown; and, secondly, it was more honourable, as it
was a proof of a military tenure, and of the descent of its possessor from the
old German freemen. For it was a long time after that socage lands, in
imitation of these, came to be granted in the same manner, for life. The
lords, or immediate tenants of the crown, having, by the means afore-mentioned,
gotten estates of continuance, and being bound for life to the king,
thought it their interest likewise to connect their tenants as strictly to them,
by granting them freeholds also; but in the oath of these sub-vassals, which
they took to their lords, there was an exception of the fealty due to the
king, from whom the land was originally derived, or of a former lord, if
such an one they had, to whom they were bound by oath before. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
sub-vassals, likewise, had not in those early times, the power of creating
vassalages, or estates for life, under them; for it was thought improper to
remove the dependence of any military man on the king to so great a distance;
and indeed it was hardly worth any man’s while, if it had been lawful,
to accept such a gift as was determinable either on the death of the superior
lord, or of his vassal, who had granted it, or lastly, on his own death<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.</p>

<p>Estates for life being now become common, and in high estimation,
it was thought proper that they should be conferred with more form and
solemnity, and that by means of what the feudal law calls Investiture, of
which there are two kinds. The first, or proper investiture, was thus given:
The lord, or one impowered by him, and he that was to be tenant, went
upon the land, and then the tenant, having taken his oath of fealty, the
lord, or his deputy (or attorney, as our law calls him) gave actual possession
to him, by putting into his hand a part of the premises, in the name of the
whole, as a turf, a twig, or a hasp of the door, in the presence of the <i>pares
curiæ</i>, that is, of the other vassals or tenants of the lord. This is what our
law calls giving livery and seizin, from the lord’s or his deputy’s delivering,
and the tenant’s taking seizin, for so the possession of a freehold or estate for
life is called. The presence of the <i>pares curiæ</i> was required equally for the
advantage of the lord, of the tenant, and of themselves; of the lord, that,
if the tenant was a secret enemy, or otherwise unqualified, he might be apprised
thereof by the peers of his court, before he admitted him; and that
they might be witnesses of the obligation the tenant had laid himself under
of doing service, and of the conditions annexed to the gift, if any there were,
which the law did not imply: for the benefit of the tenant, that they might
testify the grant of the lord, and for what services it was given; and lastly,
for their own advantage, that they might know what the land was, that it
was open for the lord to give, and not the property of any of the vassals;
and also that no improper person should be admitted a par, or peer of their
court, and consequently be a witness, or judge, in their causes<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>Hence it is, that in our law, if a man has right to enter into several lands
in the same county, an entry into one of them, in the name of all, is sufficient
to vest the seizin, that is, the possession of the freehold of all, in him; because
the same <i>pares curiæ</i> (who were in antient times the only witnesses allowed)
who know he had in their presence entered into one, know also that
he entered that one in the name of all the others; but if the lands lie in different
counties (which are distinct jurisdictions, and have different <i>pares
curiæ</i>) an entry into one county, in the name of the whole, is not sufficient;
because, as to seizin of lands in the other county, the <i>pares</i> thereof are the
only competent witnesses.</p>

<p>As the proper investiture required the actual going upon the lands, which
was often inconvenient, the improper investiture was introduced. This,
which was the second kind mentioned, was also performed in the presence
of the <i>pares curiæ</i>, thus: The intended tenant, in a most humble and lowly
manner, prays the grant of such an estate from his lord; which, when
the latter has agreed to, he invests him, by words signifying his grant, and
what it is of, accompanied by some corporeal action, as delivering him a staff,
a ring, a sword, or clothing him with a robe, which last, being the most common
method amongst the great immediate tenants of the king, gave rise to
the name <i>investiture</i>. After this, the tenant did fealty. But this improper
investiture did not transfer the actual possession of the land without subsequent
livery and seizin, and gave the tenant not a right to enter, but only a
right of action, whereby he might sue, and oblige the lord to transfer it by
an actual livery. For all these lands, being liable to services arising out of the
profits for which the lord was bound to answer to the king, his possession of
these profits by their rules was continued, until he had, by an act of public
notoriety, namely, by giving livery and seizin on the land, put it out of
him. And this maxim was, I apprehend, established also for the benefit of
the co-vassals, who could better judge by their own eyes, on the spot, whether
an injury was done by the grant to any of them, than by hearing the
lands named and described elsewhere, as, in such case, it frequently happened
that all the vassals were not present<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Hence, if the lord had granted lands by an improper investiture to A,
and had afterwards, by livery and seizin, granted them to B, they became
B’s, though he was the later invested; and the remedy A had against the
lord was not for the lands themselves, for those he had already legally parted
with to B, and could not recal, but for their value, in consideration of
his having bound himself to fealty.</p>

<p>This was the form and manner of proper and improper investitures in
the early times, before these barbarians had learned the use of letters, and
was intended not merely for solemnity, but also to create such a notoriety
of the fact, as it might easily be proved by <i>viva voce</i> testimony. For if it
was denied, the tenant produced two or more of the <i>pares curiæ</i>, each of
whom swore he had either been present at the investiture himself, or had
constantly heard his father declare, that he was. And this, at first, was the
only evidence admissible, and was abundantly sufficient, when the grants
were only for one life. Such proof, however, could not be of any advantage
to the church; for, though churchmen die, the church doth not, but
continues to be represented in a succession of natural persons. If she, therefore,
had not a more permanent evidence to produce than what I have before-mentioned,
she could never, after some length of time, ascertain her
rights. On this account <i>brevia testata</i>, or, as we call them, deeds, were made
use of, which were written instruments, expressing the grant, and its nature,
attested by some of the <i>pares</i>, and authenticated by the seal of the lord, or by
his name and sign of the cross. When this kind of evidence was once introduced,
as it was more fixed and certain than the frail memories of men,
it became customary for the tenant, who had been invested either properly
or improperly, to demand and obtain a <i>breve testatum</i> of that investiture, and
afterwards other symbols in improper investitures went out of use, and the
delivery of a deed became the ordinary sign; but this, as all other improper
investitures, required a subsequent actual livery and seizin.</p>

<p>Having thus delivered the antient and proper method of constituting an
estate for life, let us attend to the consequences, and see what were the several
rights and obligations of the lord and tenant, and for that purpose examine
the oath of fealty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>The general oath of fealty on the continent was thus: <i>Ego N. vassallus,
super hæc sancta Dei evangelia, juro, quod ab hac horâ in antea usque ad ultimum
vitæ meæ diem, tibi M. domino meo, fidelis ero, contra omnem hominem, excepta
summo pontifice, vel imperatore, vel rege, vel priore domino meo</i>, as the
case was. In England, Littleton gives this account of it. When a freeholder
doth fealty to his lord, he shall hold his right hand on a book, and shall
say thus: Know ye this, my lord, that I shall be faithful and true unto you,
and faith to you shall bear, for the lands which I claim to hold of you; and
that I shall lawfully do to you the customs and services which I ought to do,
at the terms assigned; so help me God, and his saints; and he shall kiss the
book<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.</p>

<p>The only differences are, that the words <i>ab hac hora in antea usque ad ultimum
vitæ meæ diem</i> are omitted: for abroad none but tenants for life swore
fealty. In England termers for years did; and that <i>contra omnem hominem,
excepto, &amp;c.</i> though implied, is likewise omitted; which exceptions, however,
in the English law, were inserted in the doing of homage which the
tenant in fee did to his lord.</p>

<p>Such was the general oath of fealty; but to shew what <i>being faithful
and true</i>, and <i>bearing faith</i> comprehends, it will be proper to insert, from
the seventh title of the second book of the feudal law, the larger oath,
which persons, rude and ignorant of what the word fealty implied, were to
take. It runs in these words: <i>Ego juro, quod nunquam scienter ero in consilio,
vel in facto quod tu amittas vitam, vel membrum aliquod, vel quod tu recipias
in personâ aliquam læsionem, vel injuriam, vel contumeliam, vel quod tu
amittas aliquem honorem quem nunc habes, vel in antea habebis; &amp; si scivero,
vel audivero, de aliquo, qui velit aliquod istorum contra te facere, pro posse meo,
ut non fiat impedimentum præstabo. Et si impedimentum præstare nequivero,
quam cito potero, tibi nunciabo; &amp; contra eum, prout potero, auxilium meum tibi
præstabo; &amp; si contigerit, te rem aliquam quam habes vel habebis injuste vel fortuito
casu amittere, eam recuperare juvabo, &amp; recuperatam omni tempore retinere.
Et si scivero te velle juste aliquem offendere, &amp; inde generaliter vel specialiter
fuero requisitus, meum tibi, sicut potero, præstabo auxilium. Et si aliquid mihi de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
secreto manifestaveris, illud, sine tua licentia, nemini pandam, vel per quod pandatur
faciam; &amp; si consilium mihi super aliquo facto postulaveris, illud tibi dabo
consilium, quod mihi videtur magis expedire tibi; &amp; nunquam ex persona mea
aliquid faciam scienter, quod pertineat ad tuam vel tuorum injuriam vel contumeliam.</i></p>

<p>Besides the negative obligations, of doing nothing to the prejudice of
the lord or his family, the positive ones the vassals lay under may be reduced
to the two heads of counsel and aid; which, with us, are still the
principal duties that the parliament, who are, or represent the vassals of the
king, owe to the sovereign. Under counsel, not only giving faithful advice,
but keeping his secrets was included. Aid may be either in supporting
his reputation and dignity, or defending his person or property. Under
the first, the vassal was not only to shew him the highest reverence, but was
forbid to accuse or inform against him, except in the case of treason, where
the supreme lord was concerned. He could not in a suit between them tender
to his lord the oath of calumny, whereby he should be obliged to swear
he thought his cause was just, and that he did not carry it on with an intent
to harrass and distress; for this was throwing an aspersion on his lord’s character.
He could not, for the same reason, bring any action against him,
whereby he might be defamed, and particularly the interdictum <i>unde-vi</i>,
which was a charge against the person sued, of an unjust and violent dispossession
of property. Neither could he, in any cause that was not strictly
feudal (for in such as were for the general preservation of that polity, he was
permitted) bear witness against him. And, lastly, he was obliged to support
his dignity, to attend his courts, and do suit and service, as a witness
and a juror.</p>

<p>By aid to his person, he was not only obliged to defend his lord, if attacked
personally, but to assist him in his wars, and that at his own expence,
out of the profits of his tenancy; and if, in the field of battle, he deserted
his lord, before his lord was mortally wounded, it was an absolute forfeiture.
But this aid he was not obliged to give until required; for perhaps the lord
did not need the aid of all his tenants; and the vassal, without notice, was
supposed ignorant that there was any occasion for his assistance, unless it
could be proved the vassal knew his lord’s danger, when the lord himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
did not; or that he knew it was so imminent as not to give the lord time
to summon him; in which two cases, he was obliged to serve without requisition<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<p>But here some distinctions must be taken notice of as to the nature of
these wars. I have often repeated that the king’s companions were bound
to assist him in all his undertakings, offensive or defensive; and that the
other freemen were obliged only to serve in defensive wars. But now, by
this new introduction of grants for life to the freemen, the case was altered.
In all defensive wars, they were obliged to aid their lord, though he had
been the unjust aggressor, and this for the preservation of the society to
which they belonged; but in offensive ones, it was to be considered whether
the cause was just, or doubtful, or notoriously unjust. In the two first cases,
he was obliged to furnish his aid; for if his lord’s quarrel was doubtful, the
respect and reverence he owed him, and his regard to his lord’s character
and dignity, laid him under a necessity of presuming in his superior’s favour.
But if the war was notoriously unjust, he was at liberty to serve, or not,
as he pleased. And the aid he was bound to give, where he was bound,
was against all persons, <i>contra omnem hominem</i>, even his parents, brothers,
children, and friends, with the following exceptions. First, not against
the king, who was the supreme lord of the whole, and in whose preservation
and dignity every individual was concerned. Secondly, not against himself,
for self-preservation is the first law of nature. Thirdly, not against his
original country, though he had received a grant from a foreign lord, and
afterwards war broke out between them: for by this time, the opinion of
a durable obligation to the state he was born in, began to prevail among
them. Lastly, not against his antienter lord, when he had grants from two;
for the second obligation could not annul the first. It may here be naturally
asked, how such a vassal, who had two lords, was to act in case of a war
between them? If his first lord’s cause was just or doubtful, he was undoubtedly
bound to him against the subsequent one, even in attacking him;
and this was no forfeiture, for the second lord had sufficient notice of his
prior obligation, by the exception in the oath of fealty. Indeed, if he, having
a lord before, had omitted the exception, he justly lost his fief, for the
deceit put on his latter lord. But if his first lord’s cause was notoriously unjust,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
he was not at liberty to assist him against the second; but by the two
bonds was obliged to remain neuter<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>This military duty was to be done in the vassal’s proper person, if he was
capable of it; unless the lord was pleased to accept of a deputy. But if he
was incapable himself, as often must have happened, after estates for life
came in, he was allowed to serve by a substitute, such as the lord approved.
Suppose, then, a man had two lords, who were at the same time at war
with others, and each required his personal assistance, it was plain he was
obliged to serve both, the elder lord in person, because his right was prior,
and the last by deputy<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<p>The aids due to the lord, in respect of his property, were, first, to aid and
support him, if reduced to actual indigence, and to procure his liberty, by
paying his ransom, if taken in war. It was a doubt among the feudal lawyers,
whether, if the lord was imprisoned for debts, his tenants were obliged
to release him; and the better opinion was, that they were, if the debts did
not tend to their very great impoverishment<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<p>These were all the aids necessarily required by the law in these antient
times. For those for making his eldest son a knight, and marrying his elder
daughter, came in afterwards. All other contributions and assistances were
merely voluntary, though very frequent, and were originally, as they are
still here, and are still called abroad, though imposed really and truly, <i>free
gifts</i>.</p>

<p>We are now to speak of the duty of the lord to his vassals; and on this
head there is no need of enlarging much: for it was a maxim in the feudal
law, that though the vassal only took the oath to the lord, and the lord, on
account of his dignity, and the respect due to him from the tenant, took
none; yet was he equally obliged as if he had taken it, to do every thing,
and forbear every thing, with respect to his tenant, that the vassal was with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
respect to the lord; so that the bond was in most respects strictly mutual;
but not in all, for the lord was not obliged to support his indigent tenant,
or to give aids to him; but, on the other hand, he was obliged to warrant
and defend the lands he had given to his tenant by arms, if attacked in open
war, and in courts of justice, by appearing upon his voucher, that is, the
tenant’s calling him in to defend his right, and if the lord failed, he was
bound to give lands of equal value, or, if he had not such to bestow, to
pay to the tenant (in consideration of the bond for life, he had bound himself
to his lord in) an equivalent in money.</p>

<p>As, in case of the vassal’s failure in his duty, the lands returned to the
lord, so, in case of the lord’s failure on his side, the lands were vested in
the vassal, free from all services to his immediate superior. But to the
king, or lord paramount, he still owed service, in proportion to his fief; and
by this means he might become, instead of a subvassal, an immediate vassal
of the king<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>Having mentioned the obligations on each side between lord and tenant,
it next follows to see what interest each had in the lands given; on which
head I shall be brief, as these several rights were not so nicely distinguished
as in after ages, when these tenures became hereditary. The lord was then
to suffer his tenant to enjoy the issues and profits of the lands, he rendering
the services due by the reservation of law, and the additional ones, if
any such had been specially reserved. In case of failure, he had, in those
antient times, a right of entry for the tenant’s forfeiture. For while this
military system continued in its full vigour, the smallest breach the vassal
committed in his engagements was an absolute forfeiture; but in after times,
when the lands were often given upon other considerations than military
service; and when the military was often commuted for pecuniary considerations,
a milder way was found out, that is, by <i>distress</i>, by which the
lord, instead of seizing the lands, took possession of all the goods and chattels
of his tenants found upon the lands, (for the lands were still the mark
where he was to take), and kept them as a deposit, till his tenant had made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
satisfaction, originally indeed at the lord’s pleasure, for the failure in his
duty<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p>The right the tenant had in the land was, that, paying the services due,
he should receive the produce thereof, and turn it to his own best advantage;
and that he might, if attacked in a court of justice, vouch, or call in
his lord to defend his possession by arms, or otherwise. But as his tenure
was precarious, and only for life, he was prohibited from doing any thing
that should either hurt his lord’s interest, or that of the king, in whom and
his successors the inheritance was vested. Thus, he could not commit
waste, by destroying houses, or cutting down trees, except what was necessary
for immediate use, for repairs, firing, or tillage. He could not bequeath
his tenancy, for he held only during life. He could not alienate without
the consent of his lord, for he had his lands in consideration of his personal
service; and although, in case of necessity, he was allowed a substitute,
it was only such an one as was acceptable to the lord; whereas by
alienation, the real tenant who was bound by oath to do the services out of
the profits, was to lose them, and a stranger, perhaps an enemy, who was
under no tie to the lord, was to enjoy them. Alienation, therefore, without
the consent of the lord, was unlawful. If he consented indeed, and
accepted the alienée, he, upon his taking the oath of fealty, became the
real tenant, and the former was quit of all positive service, except honour
and reverence; but still bound by his former oath from doing or suffering
any thing to the prejudice of his former lord. Neither could a sub-vassal, in
those early times, create a vassalage to be held of himself. The immediate
vassal of the king, indeed, could, but then it was on these terms; first, that
the person he granted it to was one that was of the ligeance of the king, either
natural or adopted; next, that he was as capable of rendering the services
as the grantor; and lastly, that the services reserved should, if not
better, which was expected, be at least equally beneficial to the supreme
lord as those of the original grant to the intermediate or mesne lord. To explain
this, if the king granted ten thousand acres to his immediate vassal, for
the service of ten knights, the vassal might give one thousand, indeed, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
any lesser number of acres to one person, for the service of one knight; but
if he gave more to one, as he had attempted to hurt and lessen the benefit
his superior had stipulated for, his grant was void, and in those times, when
forfeitures were regularly exacted, the grant of the king to him was forfeited
also<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>In my next lecture I shall say something of <i>improper feuds</i>, as they began
to be introduced about the time I am now upon, and were very seldom, in
those ages, granted for longer terms than for years or lives, and go on to
shew by what means, by what steps and degrees, estates for life grew up
into inheritances.</p>

</div>

<p>Having, in the preceeding lecture, laid down the manner of constituting
a proper beneficiary estate for life, which consisted in lands granted
for the defence of the state, upon the consideration of personal military
service, and the rights and obligations annexed thereto; it will be proper to
mention such, (and to point out the several kinds of them) as are called improper
benefices, which are those that, in one or more particulars, recede
from the strict, and, in antient times, the usual nature of those grants; and
this is more especially necessary, as, since the abolishing the military tenures
in Charles the Second’s time, all our present estates come under one or other
of these heads. It was a maxim in the feudal law, that <i>conventio modum
dat donationi</i>; and therefore, whatever terms the donor prescribed, though
varying from the general course, was the rule by which the grant was to be
regulated.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, all benefices granted to the church were improper
ones, because given on other terms than that of military service, and because
they ended not with the death of the grantor or grantee, but continued
coeval with the life of the church, that is, for ever<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, Grants of lands, wherein the oath of fealty was remitted; for
although fealty itself was an incident, essential to, and inseparable from,
every estate of life abroad, and every estate of years also in England, the
ceremony of actually taking the oath might be omitted; and if the lord had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
put the tenant in possession, without his having taken the oath, the tenant
might enjoy without it. He was obliged, indeed, to take it whenever his
lord called upon him, on pain of forfeiture; unless, in the investiture, it
had been expressly remitted; in which case, he might refuse to take it, and
justify his refusal by the tenor of his investiture<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, All grants to which there was a condition annexed, that either
enlarged or diminished the estate; as if lands were granted to two, and the
survivor of them. This was an improper benefice, as it had continuance
for more than one life; or if they were granted to a man for life, provided
he did, or refrained from doing such an act. This was improper also, because
it might have a more speedy determination.</p>

<p>Fourthly, All grants, in which certain services beside military were reserved,
were also of this nature, as if the tenure was by military service and
a certain rent, or any other certain duty, or by military service reduced to
a certainty, as to attend, suppose forty days and no more, or by military service
with a power in the tenant to excuse himself, by paying a certain sum.
For the proper fief was for military service only, the occasions and duration
of which were uncertain<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<p>Fifthly, If military service was not reserved at all, but some other certain
service instead thereof, as rent, the grant was an improper one, and
such are our tenures, since they have been reduced to socage, which is derived
from <i>soke</i> or <i>soka</i>, a plough, because their duty was originally to attend
a certain number of days to plow their lord’s grounds, or else to supply
him with a certain quantity of corn in lieu thereof. This manner of paying
in kind, namely, by corn, cattle or other necessaries, was continued every
where many ages; in England, until the time of Henry the first, when
they began to be commuted into money, to the great advantage of the successors
of these socage tenants, whose estates were before become hereditary.
For the computation being made at the rate and proportion of value
between money and the necessaries of life at that time, as money grew
more plentiful every day, its value continually sunk, and the price of commodities
accordingly increased; in so much that the present successor of a tenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
at that time, who had before paid a fat ox, which was changed into
twenty shillings, its then value, would now pay but the eight part of the original
reservation, when the price of an ox is eight pounds. And this contributed
not a little to the happy equality which now reigns among all ranks,
as these baser, the socage tenures, were continually rising in value, and consequently
in consideration, and coming every day nearer to an equality, in
the estimation of the world, with the nobler, the military benefices<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p>Sixthly, If no services at all were reserved, except general fealty, which
could not be remitted; for it was thought reasonable, not only to grant
lands in consideration of future military service, but also to reward such as
had deserved eminently, and were perhaps maimed or mutilated, and so unfit
for future service, with lands free from such, or any other duty.</p>

<p>Seventhly, Grand serjeanty is a benefice of an improper nature, even
though it be reckoned a military one, because it is reduced to a certainty.
Grand serjeanty is a certain service done by the body of a man to the person
of the king, and is of two kinds; military, which is to be done either in or
out of the realm; and not military, which is to be done within the realm.
Military, as when lands are given on condition of carrying the banner of the
king, or his lance, or to lead his army, that is, to be his constable; or to
number and array his army, that is, to be his marshal; but these being <i>certain</i>
services, and due to the person of the king, they were not obliged to
attend, but where he went in person; and this right they insisted on so
strongly, as had almost occasioned a rebellion in the time of Edward the
First; who, although in most things an excellent prince, was of an hot and
haughty temper<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.</p>

<p>Having determined to attack France on two sides; in Flanders, where
he intended to command himself, and in Guienne; he ordered the Earl of
Hereford, high constable by tenure, and the Earl of Norfolk, marshal by tenure,
to lead the army in Guienne, as his generals and commanders in chief.
But, however honourable and pleasing in other respects the offer might be,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
they feared that such a precedent, quietly complied with, might be, in after
times, a means of introducing new and hard services at the king’s pleasure,
instead of the antient and known ones. They, therefore, flatly refused, unless
he went thither himself; offering, at the same time, to serve under him
in Flanders. The king, boiling with resentment against France, and provoked
at this contradiction to his pleasure, however justly founded, threatened
Norfolk, in a transport of passion, with hanging; to which the other
replied, with equal fierceness, and total want of respect. The two Earls retired
to their estates, put themselves in a state of defence, and even committed
several outrages against the king’s collectors; and their cause was generally
espoused by the nation, who were against the king’s exacting any new
and unheard-of services. The behaviour of these lords to their sovereign,
and to such a sovereign, in setting him at defiance, and that with terms of
disdain, when they themselves were the aggressors, was utterly unjustifiable;
but, from their cause, notwithstanding this behaviour of theirs, being universally
espoused by the nation, we may clearly see the opinion and judgment
of those times; that their kings were not unlimited, and that they had
no right to exact from their vassals any services but those that flowed from
their tenures. The king, indeed, at first gave their lands and offices to
others; but when he had cooled, and found they had insisted on no more
than was their right, he, in the frankest manner, repaired his error. He
gave in parliament a new confirmation of Magna Charta. By another statute,
he renounced all right of taking talliages, that is, levying taxes, even
on his own demesnes, without consent of parliament, as contrary to that charter;
and in the body of this last act, in the amplest manner, remitted all disgust
and resentment against the two earls and their associates; and gave
them the fullest indemnity for the offences they had so outrageously committed.
Such conduct in any king, whose subjects were not disposed to esteem
him, might have been as a sign of weakness, and have been attended
with dismal consequences; but in Edward’s realms there was not a man that
did not admire his wisdom, adore him for his valour, his honour, and his
sincerity. He could encroach without incurring hatred, and he could retract
without being thought mean; so that it may be a question, whether, by
the noble manner of his repairing his mistake, he did not tie his subjects to
him with stronger bonds of affection, than if he had never committed it<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>The grand serjeanties that are not military are of various kinds, being
offices and services done to the person of the king within the realm, in order
to the support of his state and dignity; for which reason, although they are
not, properly speaking, military services, yet they are looked upon in that
light, and are endowed with the same privileges, and subject to the same
regulations, except in a few instances, to be hereafter mentioned; so that
no person under the rank of the lesser nobility, that is, of knighthood, was
capable of performing them; and therefore, when, by allowing the alienation
of lands, these tenures fell into the hands of persons of inferior quality,
they were either knighted, or appointed a deputy of that rank. Thus,
at the coronation of Richard the Second, as we find in Lord Coke, William
Furnivall claimed to find a globe for the right hand of the king, and to
support his hand on the day of his coronation, in virtue of the manor of
Farnham, which he held by that grand serjeanty; but, though descended
of a noble family, he was not permitted to perform it in person, until he
had been dubbed a knight. At the same coronation, John Wiltshire, citizen
of London, claimed to hold a towel while the king washed before dinner,
which claim being allowed, as he was of too low rank to perform the
service in person, he made Edmund Earl of Cambridge his deputy. Women
likewise and minors were obliged to serve by deputy; as did, at that
time, Anne Countess-dowager of Pembroke, by Sir John Blount, and her
son John Earl of Pembroke, a minor, by Edmund Earl of March<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<p>These grand serjeanties, which were most of them lands granted for
the doing certain duties at the solemnity of the coronation, contributing
to the splendour and dignity of the crown, have been still retained, though
all other military tenures have been changed into free and common socage.
However, all these grand serjeanties were not for the bare purpose of attending
at coronations. The lord high stewardship or seneschalship of England,
of which the duty is to preside at the trials of peers, was annexed to
the barony of Hinckly, which, passing into the family of Leicester, and then
into that of Lancaster, in the person of Henry the Fourth was united to
the crown; but ever since that time, as the powers and privileges the law
threw into his hands were looked upon as too extensive, and dangerous, if
continued, this officer hath only been occasionally created, as for a coronation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
or the trial of a peer, which ended, he breaks his staff, and the office
is vacant<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. The same is the case, and for the same reason, of the office of
high-constable, ever since the attainder, in Henry the Eighth’s time, of Edward
Duke of Buckingham, who enjoyed it as Earl of Hereford. Thus did
the crown get rid of two considerable checks, which concurring with other
more extensive and influencing causes, helped to raise the power of the house
of Tudor above what the princes of the line of Plantagenet had enjoyed<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.
The office of earl marshal, indeed still continues in the noble family of Norfolk.
For, notwithstanding the attainders of that family, when they were
restored, it also was restored to them. The reason is, because this office
is of little power; indeed, in the vacancy of the constable to whom he is
properly an assistant, scarce of any at all. It being, therefore, an honourable
dignity, and attended with no danger, it is no wonder it hath remained<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.
In this kingdom one grand serjeanty remained till the year 1715, in
the family of Ormond, that of butlerage; but it differed from those before-mentioned
in this, that it was not a service arising from a grant of lands,
but of the prisage of wines, an antient profit of the crown, due by prerogative,
namely, a right to take two tons of wine, one before the mast, and
the other behind, out of every ship containing twenty tons or more, until
Charles the Second purchased it from the Duke of Ormond by a perpetual
pension of four thousand pounds a year<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>Eighthly, Petty serjeanty was another species of improper benefices,
and, in our law, was comprised under the general head of <i>socage</i>, because
the service was certain. It is, as Littleton<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> defines it, where a man holds
his land of our sovereign lord the king, to yield to him yearly a bow or a
sword, or a dagger, or a knife, or a lance, or a pair of gloves of mail, or
a pair of gilt spurs, or an arrow, or divers arrows; or to yield such other
small things belonging to war; so this, as well as grand serjeanty, was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
tenure of the king’s person, and could not be held of a subject. Such is
the grant the Lord Baltimore hath in his province of Maryland; for he
yields every Christmas five Indian arrows, besides a fifth of all gold and silver
found within this province.</p>

<p>Ninthly, All grants to women were of the nature of improper ones, because
they must always serve by deputy; and personal service is essential to
the proper military tenures<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. But these were not introduced so early.</p>

<p>The tenth kind, and the last that I shall mention, of improper benefices,
are those that are of <i>things not corporeal</i>, and of which, consequently, there
cannot be a possession manually delivered over, that is, they do not admit of
livery and seizin, and therefore can be only conveyed by the improper investiture,
that is, by words or writing, accompanied by a symbol. Such are
rights in, or profits issuing out of land, where another hath the possession of
it. As the feudal law distinguishes between corporeal things, whose possession
can be actually transferred, and incorporeal, which cannot; so doth
our law make what is the same distinction between things that lie in livery,
and things that lie in grant. In the first, it regularly requires an actual livery
and seizin, and here a deed is not absolutely necessary; but the second
pass by the delivery of the deed. Here therefore a deed is absolutely
necessary; for although the feudal law admits the use of other symbols in
this case, ours, for the greater certainty, precisely requires this peculiar one,
that there may be full evidence of what was conveyed. Of this last tenth
kind as there are many and various species, I shall run over some of them
in a cursory manner, to explain and shew their general nature.</p>

<p>The first I shall take notice of is, that which, I presume, was the most
antient, as it seems to have come in the place of those repasts the king gave
to his comites, or companions, and is what is called <i>feudum de cavena</i>. <i>Cavena</i>
signified the repository, or repositories of the necessaries of life, while
in those ancient times the services due from the demesnes, or the socage
lands, to the king or lords, were paid in kind. Things therefore necessary,
or useful for the support of life, distributed in specie, out of the king’s or
lord’s cellar or pantry, or both, were what the <i>feudum cavena</i> consisted in;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
and that this came in place of the antient constant entertainments, and
feasts, of the comites, or companions, appears from this, that it was a rule,
even after other grants were allowed to be hereditary, that these determined
with the life of the grantor, or grantee, which ever first happened to expire.
These grants likewise were of two kinds; some granted in consideration
of future services, upon the failure of which a forfeiture was incurred,
others, in reward for past services, where nothing was expected for the
future but general fealty. This difference runs through many other of
these gifts that lie in grant. For the feudal law distinguishes them into
<i>officiosa</i>, that is, to which a positive duty is annexed, and <i>inofficiosa</i>, where
no subsequent service is required, but general fidelity, which is incident to
every tenure<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.</p>

<p>The second I shall mention is <i>feudum de camera</i>, which, I apprehend, was
originally a substitution for what I have just mentioned, the <i>feudum de cavena</i>;
for it was instead of an allowance of necessaries out of the cellar or
pantry of the king, an annual allocation of a sum of money for will, life,
or years, according as it was granted out of the <i>camera</i>, or chamber where
the king or lord kept his money; and this was, as the other I before mentioned
into whose room it came, either a reward for past services, in which
case no future duty was required, or on consideration of future ones. The
pensions granted by the king in our kingdom (Ireland) out of his revenue,
are of the nature of the former; and the salaries to judges and other officers
are of the nature of the latter. What was common to both of these, the
<i>feudum de camera &amp; de cavena</i>, was, that, by the feudal law, they were not
due at the stated time, unless there were provisions in the <i>cavena</i>, or money
in the <i>camera</i>, and that free from debts; for the lord’s safety and dignity
was to be first considered; but they were to wait for their arrear, till provisions
or money came in.</p>

<p>Another thing is to be observed, that, although, at the introduction of
these tenures, all others were for the life of the grantor and grantee at most,
yet when the others became perpetual, these continued long after to be only
for the joint lives of the grantor and grantee, namely, as long as kings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
great lords were considered as tenants for life, and incapable of alienating
their demesnes, or laying any permanent charge upon them. But when, by
the frequency of the example of alienations, and by the occasional indigence
of the kings and other lords, and the desire designing persons had to take
advantage of it, alienations of the demesnes were once introduced, to the
prejudice of the successor, these grants, as was very natural, as they were
less hurtful than an absolute alienation, were continued for the life of the
grantee, though the grantor had died before<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

advowsons—Collative advowsons—Donatives.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In the preceding lecture I began to treat of the several kinds of improper
benefices, which are transferable only by the improper investiture, or,
as the English law says, <i>lie in grant</i>; intending only to illustrate their general
nature, without descending minutely into particulars; and of these I have
already mentioned the <i>feudum de camera</i>, and that <i>de cavena</i>. I call these
fiefs, even at the time I am now treating of, in conformity with the practice
of the feudal writers: not with strict propriety, indeed; for <i>feudum</i>, properly
speaking, signifies a tenure of inheritance, and such were not yet introduced.
But before I quit them, it will be proper to take notice of some subdivisions
of them, to be met with in the feudal writers.</p>

<p>I have already observed they were either gratuitous or officious, that is,
without future service, or with it. Of the first kind there were two species,
that called <i>feudum soldatæ</i>, from the word <i>solidus</i>, which signified a piece of
money, and was a gratuitous pension, granted either out of the charity or
bounty of the lord, or in reward of past services; the other called <i>feudum
habitationis</i>; which is liberty of dwelling in an house belonging to the lord,
in whom the property still doth, and the possession is still supposed to remain<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.
Of the officious ones Corvinus mentions three kinds, <i>feudum guardiæ</i>,
<i>feudum gastaldiæ</i>, and <i>feudum mercedis</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>feudum guardiæ</i> hath annexed to it the defence of a castle, for the
security of the realm; and this differs from the castle guard I have before
mentioned, in as much as that, where lands were given for the defence of
the castle, it was a corporeal benefice, and transferred by livery and seizin;
namely, by admitting the constable into the castle, and delivering him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
key thereof, and was an improper one only in respect of its duration, as, in
the early times, it continued only a year; but this I am now speaking of was
a pension, paid out of the king’s exchequer for the same purpose; and was
of the same nature with the modern salaries of governors of garrisons<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>feudum gastaldiæ</i> was a pension granted to a person for transacting
the lord’s business, as for being his treasurer, steward, agent, or receiver.
The <i>feudum mercedis</i> was in consideration of being an advocate or defender
of the lord. Such are grants to lawyers <i>pro consilio impendendo</i>; and the salaries
of the king’s lawyers, and the solicitors for the crown<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall next run over briefly the several kinds of incorporeal benefices
which the law of England takes notice of, and explain their general nature.
And the first I shall take notice of is an <i>advowson</i>, which is a right a man
hath of nominating a proper person to fulfil the duties, and to receive the
profits of an ecclesiastical benefice. These rights arose thus. In the infancy
of the christian church, when the clergy were supported by the voluntary
contributions of the people, the bishop was chosen by the clergy and
people at large; and this method was so firmly established, that when the
emperors became christians, although they made great donations of lands to
the church, yet they left the manner of election as they found it; and so it
continued in Rome until the year 1000 at least. But these elections, made
by the giddy multitude, were the occasions of infinite disorders. The value
of these offices being encreased, and the manners of the ecclesiastics corrupted
by the accession of riches; parties and factions were eternally forming,
and supported by all methods; and when a vacancy happened, the contest
was frequently not decided without bloodshed. It is no wonder that all
the sober part of the clergy, who were scandalized at these irreligious practices,
and the emperors, who were concerned in the peace of their dominions,
concurred in remedying these evils; which was at length effected by excluding
the laity, gradually, and by insensible degrees, and confining the
election to the ecclesiastics. Many of the emperors, indeed, struggled hard
to get the nomination to themselves, but the clergy proving too powerful
for them, they obtained, at most, but a power of recommendation<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>In the northern kingdoms the same causes produced the same effects, as
to the exclusion of the laity, but with more advantageous circumstances to
the rights of these princes. For as the lands they gave to the bishops in
right of their churches were held of them, so they gave the investiture;
and there was a kind of concurring right between the clergy, who elected,
and the king. He insisted on his right of giving the investiture, but generally
received their nominee, and granted it to him.</p>

<p>But after the time of Charles Martel, when the clergy were stripped of
most of their lands, things took a different turn. For when new grants
were made to the church by the king, he insisted, as feudal lord, on the absolute
nomination, and the giving investiture, by delivering the staff or crosier,
the emblem of his pastoral care, and the ring, the symbol of his spiritual
marriage with the church; but these rights were opposed by the
clergy, who were strongly supported by the popes then setting up for
being the feudal lords of all churchmen, and who hoped to derive, as they
did, great advantage from these dissentions. From the year 1000 to 1200,
great confusion subsisted throughout all Europe, occasioned by these contests,
until the popes in general prevailed; but for four hundred years past,
and particularly since the reformation, their power hath been on the decline;
and from this last period the patronage or advowson of bishoprics
hath been confessedly in our king, as hath been the case in several other
kingdoms; and though in England a form of election is still retained, it is
no more than a mere form<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p>The advowson, or patronage of inferior benefices, came in another way.
In order to understand this, let us consider how dioceses came to be subdivided
into parishes. Antiently, I mean about the year 420, the bishop
had the sole cure of souls throughout his whole district, and received all the
profits of it; which he and the clergy distributed into four parts, not exactly
equal ones; but unequal, according to the exigences of the several interests
to be considered; one to the bishop, to maintain hospitality, and support
the clergy residing with him, and the Christians of other places, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
were often forced to fly from persecution, or travelled on their necessary
concerns; one for the building and repair of churches; one for the poor,
and one to support the inferior clergy, whom the bishop used to send to particular
places, as his deputies, and to remove or recal at his pleasure. The
clergy who lived in the city where the bishop resided, were supported by
him in a collegiate way at first; until at length their particular shares were
ascertained, and carved out of the general revenue of the church; and this
was the origin of <i>chapters</i><a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>To return to the country clergy. The manner in which they came to
have settled establishments was thus: It was usual, as soon indeed as tithes
were established as a law, that is, before or about the time of Charlemagne,
for the bishop to allocate to his vicar or curate in any district, the whole, or
a part of the tithes or other profits arising there; but when England,
France, and other countries were ravaged by the Danes and Normans, the
fury of these barbarous heathens fell particularly on the ecclesiastics. Their
churches they burned, and themselves they slaughtered without mercy; insomuch
that, when their devastations ceased, there ensued not only a great
scarcity of clergymen, but such a want of means of proper support for them
(the old estates of the church having been turned into military fiefs) that the
feudal lords were willing, for the sake of having divine service performed
in their districts, for the benefit of themselves and their vassals, to alienate
part of their lands to the church, which was then in indigence, for the purpose
of building houses for the parson, and providing a competent glebe for
him, and also for building new churches where they were wanted. Altho’
alienation was at this time entirely disallowed by the feudal customs, yet the
necessity of those times prevailed against it in those instances, especially as
these superstitious people attacked, or ready to be attacked by an heathen
enemy, thought the lands so given to be really given for military service,
as they were given for the service of God, the Lord of Hosts, who was to
speed their arms. However, the circumstances and opinions of that age
would not allow any grant, without an acknowledgment of the superiority
of the grantor; nor allow any lord to give any grant materially detrimental
to his military fief. Hence, as an acknowledgment that the lands so granted
to the church proceeded from the bounty of the Lord, he was allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
nominate a clergyman to the bishop; who, if he was qualified, was obliged
to admit him. But as the patron might present an improper person, and
such an one as the bishop must be obliged in conscience to reject; and
might do this repeatedly, for any considerable length of time, during which
the duties of religion would be neglected, it was, in after times, settled, in
all countries, that the right of the patron’s presentation should last only a
limited time. In our countries it is six months; after which time lapsed
from the vacancy, the bishop’s original right of nomination revives<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p>But the customs of those ages not admitting of the alienation of any part
of a military tenure, but what was absolutely necessary, it followed that these
glebes were far from being sufficient for the maintenance of a parson. These
grants, therefore, were not made without the consent of the bishop, to allocate,
in aid of the glebe, the tithes of that precinct, to the use of the parson.
And now the parson began to have a permanent interest for life in his parish,
and a permanent cure of souls therein; but not exclusive of the cure of
souls in the bishop, who was concomitant with him in that point, though not
in the profits. For when the bishop, for the good of the church, appropriated
a part of the revenues of the church to a particular person and his
successors, which, for the public good, he was allowed to do, he could not,
however, divest himself, or his successor, of that general cure of souls
through his whole district, which was the essence of his office. As the parson,
therefore, though named by a layman, was his deputy, he was in truth
(to speak by way of accommodation) his feudal tenant. From him he received
institution, which is the improper investiture; to him he gave the
oath of canonical obedience, which is equivalent to the oath of fealty; and
by him, or persons appointed by him, he was inducted into his church, that
is, had livery and seizin given him<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p>This was the origin and nature of presentative advowsons, in which,
though a matter ecclesiastical, the lay patron was allowed to have a temporal
and a valuable interest: inasmuch as it might serve for a provision of one of
his children, or any other relation that was qualified for it; and consequently
be an ease to him; and as, at the time that these glebes were granted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
most fiefs were hereditary, at least none were suffered to be granted but by
those who had such (because the lord superior might else be disinherited)
this right of <i>advowson presentative</i> descended to the heir. The church in its
distress exceedingly encouraged and fostered these rights for a time; but
when her circumstances changed, and, in ages when profound ignorance
prevailed both among the clergy and laity, many were the attempts to deprive
the laity of their rights, and many the exclamations against the impropriety
and impiety of such persons pretending to name any one to an holy
office. But I do not find they ever thought of restoring to the laity the
glebes, in consideration of which, for the necessities of the church, those
rights were first allowed.</p>

<p>Thus much for <i>presentative advowsons</i>, which, I hope, from what hath
been already observed, will be sufficiently understood for the present. I now
must proceed to <i>collative advowsons</i>, namely, those given by the bishop,
which were of two kinds; either absolutely in his own right, or by lapse,
when the patron neglected to present; which was in truth but a devolution
of the antient right he had parted with, to him; and therefore, as there is
no substantial difference, they may well be treated of together. As the bishop
in the case of lapse, collates, that is, institutes in his former right in default
of the person who had the right of presentation, I observed before, that the
bishop had used to grant to the country clergy a part or the whole of the
tithes of the precincts they served in; but when once, by the allowance of
presentative advowsons, parsons had got freeholds in them, the example
became contagious, and much to the benefit of the church. Those parts of
the diocese which still remained in the bishop’s hands were divided into
parishes; and the tithes of them, or at least a considerable part of them,
were assigned to the minister for his life. I need observe no farther of these,
than to say, that they differed no otherways in their nature from the last
mentioned, than that, as a patron had nothing here to do, there was no
presentation, and that <i>collation</i> is, in the case where the bishop hath the sole
right, what is called <i>institution</i> in the case of a clerk presented.</p>

<p>The third and last kind of advowsons are those called <i>donatives</i>, in the
giving seizin of which the bishop hath nothing to do, such livings being privileged,
and exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and visitable by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
patron only. How these exemptions arose, when, at first, every place was a
part of a diocese, and of the bishop’s cure of souls, it will be worth while to
inquire. The bishops of Rome, aided by their great riches, and the fall of
the western empire, did, by pursuing a settled plan for many hundred years,
with the greatest art and unshaken perseverance (temporizing indeed when
the season was unfit, but never giving up expressly any point that had been
claimed) at length, instead of being the first bishops in rank, attained to a jurisdiction
over all the west, and claimed a general cure of souls, which made
the bishops, indeed, but pastors under them. However, conscious of their
usurpations, in order to establish them, it was necessary to depress the episcopal
order.</p>

<p>They began first with dismembering bishoprics, in order to found new
ones, on pretence of the churches being better served; and this they did
principally in Italy, where their influence was most extensive; and that with
a view, by having a greater number of votes, to over-rule the determination
of the general councils. They did the same, but more sparingly, for the
reason aforesaid, in other countries, with the sovereigns; who, in these cases,
were really actuated by the motive of advancing the public good, and promoting
religion. The next step was more decisive. Their authority being
now established, they took occasion, on several pretences, to exempt from
the jurisdiction of the bishops, several places within their dioceses, which
they kept immediately under themselves, to which they appointed clerks by
this way of donation, and whom they visited by their legates, as their immediate
ordinary. The clergy, thus provided for, served as faithful servants
and spies to the pope, in all parts of the christian world, and were, next to
the monasteries, the firmest support of his power. The same practice they
pursued with respect to bishoprics, by exempting several of them in divers
places from the archbishop of the province. And this was the origin of
donatives. But, in order to shew the plenitude of their power, the next
step they took was of a higher strain. They not only founded donatives for
themselves, but for others, even of the laity; shewing by this, that all ecclesiastical
jurisdiction and discipline was entirely subject to their will, and that,
at pleasure, they could transfer it to hands before judged incapable of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>These two kind of donatives still subsist in England, the latter in the
hands of subjects, the former of the king as supreme ordinary, since the
pope’s usurped power was transferred to Henry the Eighth. I am sensible
many common lawyers insist that the king of England was always supreme
ordinary, and that nothing new was gained at that time, but only his old
authority, which the pope had usurped, restored to him. But what shall we
say to the first fruits and tenths; which are certainly papal impositions, and
comparatively of a modern date. The same I apprehend to be the case of
the ordinary jurisdiction. As to the supreme patronage, I allow it was,
originally, the king’s. My reason is, that I do not find in the antient church
any trace of a layman solely exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction, or enacting
laws for the church<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>In the apostolic times all things were transacted by the <i>faithful</i> at large;
in the next age, they fell into the hands of the clergy, all excepting the election
of bishops, and approbation of clergymen. After the emperors became
christians, they published indeed ecclesiastical laws, but that was only giving
the sanction of the imperial power to the canons the church had made; whose
censures, when there were such multitudes of new and counterfeit converts,
were likely to have little weight. In the northern nations the case was the
same. Canons were made by the clergy, and these were often enforced and
turned into obligatory laws by their general assemblies, who had the legislative
authority; and if there are any instances in those times of laymen exercising
ecclesiastical discipline as ordinaries, I own they have escaped me.
I speak merely of ecclesiastical discipline: for as to things of a temporal
concern, such as wills, administrations, marriages, tithes, &amp;c. the authority
undoubtedly was from the king. But not as to matters entirely spiritual,
such as concern the <i>salutem animæ</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>I think therefore the king’s title to be supreme ordinary, stands better
settled on the parliamentary declaration, and on the reason of the thing, that
all coercive power should be derived from him, whom God hath made the
superintendant; than on the assertions of lawyers, that it always was so.
Matters of fact are to be determined by evidence, not by considering what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
ought to have been; and we need not be surprized to find, that an ignorant
and superstitious people allowed practices, and a division of power in themselves
unreasonable.</p>

<p>In these donatives there was neither institution nor induction. The patron
gave his clerk a title by deed, on which he entered; for the plenitude
of the papal power supplied all forms. The patron was the visitor, and had
the power of deprivations; but what clearly shews, in my apprehension,
that these donatives were incroachments on the episcopal authority, is, that,
if once a common patron (for the king was saved by his prerogative) had
presented his clerk, and he got institution and induction, the donative was
gone for ever. The living became presentative, and the bishop’s jurisdiction
revived.</p>

<p><i>Tithes—The voluntary contributions of the faithful, the original revenue of the
church—The establishment of regular payments—The appropriations of the
church—The history and general rules of tithes in England.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The next kind of incorporeal benefices taken notice of by the law of
England, that I shall mention is <i>tithes</i>; the New Testament, as well as
common reason, says, that <i>they who serve by the altar, should live by the altar</i>;
but is silent as to the manner in which this support should arise. In the very
first times, when their numbers were but few, and those confined to Jerusalem
and its neighbourhood; the christians sold all they had, and lived out
of the common stock. But this lasted a very short time. When they increased
to multitudes, that method was found impracticable, so that each
retained his possessions, and gave a voluntary contribution out of it at his
discretion. This was the fund of the church; and in those times of fervent
zeal in the laity, and simplicity of manners in the clergy, it was found abundantly
sufficient, not only to support the ministers, and their own power, but
also to build churches, and to do many acts of charity to some of the pagans.</p>

<p>The revenues of the church went on continually encreasing to the time
of Constantine; and though by the Roman laws, no <i>colleges</i>, as they called
them, that is, communities or fraternities, unless they had the sanction of the
imperial authority, could accept legacies or donations, yet, such was the devotion
of the times, that many such private grants were made; and the
principal churches obtained great acquisitions, not only in moveable goods,
but in landed estates; insomuch that some of the persecuting emperors were
thought to be as much instigated to their cruelties by avarice, as by their
blind attachment to their pagan superstition<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>In the fourth century, the restraint being taken away, these largesses
from the rich and superstitious, to the church became much greater; but
the general voluntary contributions from all who could spare, diminished,
the apparent necessity for them being lessened; and the zeal of the people,
which persecution had kept warm and fervent, slackened from ease and security.
The bishops, who were the distributers, prided in vying with each
other in the magnificence of their churches; and, being now raised to an
eminent rank in the state, were not satisfied to live in such a manner as
contented the simplicity of the antient fathers of the church; so that by the
year 400, the inferior clergy and the poor were, in many places, but in very
scanty circumstances. This induced many of the pious to fix upon a certain
rate out of their own annual gains to supply these necessities, and as the
tenth was what had been assigned to the Levites in the mosaical law, that generally
became the proportion. But as the payments of those tithes were
purely voluntary, so did the givers appropriate them in such manner as they
pleased, and as they thought they were most wanted<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>In Egypt, where, it seems, this practice began, they were commonly given
to the monks, who had devoted themselves to a religious poverty; in Illyricum
generally to the poor; in other places to the inferior clergy of such
a district, or, if the church itself was indigent, to the bishop, for the use of
his church. The famous preachers about this time, particularly St. Ambrose
and St. Augustine, inforced this practice with all their eloquence, and insisted
on the levitical law of tithes as binding on christians. This had great,
but not general effects. Some gave the tithe, others, of more zeal, gave
more, and others less; and though these contributions began now to be
aided by the spiritual arms of excommunication, yet were these only used to
oblige a man, in testimony of his being a christian, to make some offering,
not to pay precisely the tenth, or any other portion<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>These payments of the tenth hitherto we see were voluntary; but there
soon came in another practice, which, in particular places, made them compulsory.
It was usual when a patron founded a church, in order for its support,
to charge his lands with the payment of tithes to the minister who officiated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
therein. This created a permanent right in the church, not by the
force of any general law, or canon (for all such attributed to these ages are
forgeries of a later date) but from the especial gift of the grantor, and the
power he had to charge his land. The earliest authority that proves a general
right of tithes, through any country of Europe, is to be met with in the
council of Mascon, held under king Guntram, who reigned in the south-east
parts of France, in the year 586. There the right of tithes, through all
his dominions, is acknowledged as an antient duty due to the church; and
they are enjoined to be regularly paid. But it is observable, in the very
words of this law, that the tithes so paid were not solely appropriated to the
clergy, but much of them applied to other charitable uses, <i>unde statuimus,
ut decimas ecclesiasticas omnis populus inferat, quibus sacerdotes, aut in pauperum
usum, aut in captivorum redemptionem erogatis, suis orationibus pacem populo &amp;
salutem impetrant</i>. Thus the kingdom of Burgundy was the first that established
the universal payment of tithes by a positive law. This payment, in
the other parts of France, was long after at pleasure, or by particular foundation;
but was daily gaining ground, especially after the impoverishment
of the church by Charles Martel rendered them more necessary; and his
grandson Charlemagne was the first that established them by a positive law,
made in a general assembly of the states, through all France; and that as
due by a divine right, in the year 778. And as he and his successors were
masters also of Germany and Italy, the same law and opinion soon passed
into those countries<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>But as positive as his law was, in the direction of payment of them to
the bishop or priest, it was for a long time not universally obeyed, and where
it was obeyed, often shamefully eluded, as appears by the laws of his successors,
and many ecclesiastical canons framed for the redressing those mischiefs.
For as a portion of the tithes was originally distributed to the
poor, under this pretence, it was customary for the superstitious laity, when
they granted the tithes, instead of aligning them for the maintenance of the
ministering, <i>i. e.</i> the secular clergy, to appropriate them to monasteries,
which were societies of voluntary poor. These appropriations, or consecrations,
as they were called, became very numerous, both from the unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
veneration paid to the monks, and from the encouragement such
grants received from the see of Rome, which looked upon the monastic orders
as its fastest friends, and was bent upon raising them on the ruin of the
secular clergy. But as the monks of those times were generally laymen,
and incapable of serving the cure, it grew into a practice for them, if any of
their own body was fit for the purpose, to get him ordained; or if they had
none, to employ a secular priest, to perform the divine offices, under the
name of their vicar or deputy, who was to account with them for the profits,
and was to receive for his subsistence a stipulated proportion; and thus
came in the division of parochial tithes, into <i>rectorial</i> and <i>vicarial</i>; the former
remaining in the <i>employer</i>, the latter in the <i>employed</i>, who did the duty<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.</p>

<p>The same pretence of appropriating the tithes to the poor gave a handle
likewise to many, when they found it necessary to pay tithes, to grant them
to laymen in fee, under the like conditions and services as other fiefs; and
many likewise were the unworthy churchmen, who turned the incomes of
their church into provisions for their families, by granting them in fief.
Thus, in process of time, were the ministering clergy, and the real poor, for
whose support the tithes were originally granted, in a great measure stripped
of them; and they were converted either into lay inheritances, for secular
services, or applied to the support of monasteries; and both these abuses
began under the specious pretence of charity. The latter, <i>viz.</i> the grants
to monks, was always favoured by the heads of the church; and the former,
in spite of all their censures, prevailed, until, at length, it was found
necessary to apply some remedy to both. The evils were too inveterate to
be finally removed; but this temper was found out in the council of Lateran,
held in 1215, when it was enacted, That all tithes which from time
immemorial had been given in fief might so continue, but no more be
granted in that manner for the future; and the appropriations to monasteries
were confined to three orders of monks who were looked upon as the
most learned, and capable of furnishing men fit for the duty<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall proceed now to say something of the fate of tithes in England.
That tithes had been paid in several parts of England during the heptarchy,
and established by law in some of its kingdoms, is undeniable; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the first who ordained them by law, through all England, was Ethelwolf,
in his parliament of the year 855; who had been himself, in his elder brother’s
life, designed for the church; in this imitating Charlemagne, at
whose court his father had long resided. This may well be allowed, although
those authors that give us the copy of this law differ in the date, both as to
the time and place where it was made. But be that as it may, his son
Alfred certainly made a law for this purpose, to bind not only his own
English, but also the new converted Danes, to whom he assigned seats in
his kingdom, and whom he had submitted to the government of Guthrun.
Such laws were renewed by almost every one of his successors down to the
Norman conquest; an evident proof, that however zealous those princes
were for the support of the church, their pious intentions were but ill seconded
by their people. The severity of the law of Edgar was remarkable,
and of itself sufficient cause of their backwardness; for it made the non-payment
of the tenth a forfeiture of eight-tenths. The <i>præpositus</i> of the king
and bishop, that is, I presume, the sheriff and arch-deacon, were to seize the
fruits out of which the tithes had been with-held, and when they were divided
into ten parts, one was given to the church that had been defrauded,
another to the proprietor, and the remaining eight were divided between
the king and the bishop<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>During these times appropriations of tithes, to other churches than the
parish one, and also to monasteries, were frequent, here as well as on the
continent; but, for some time after the conquest, the largesses to the
monks, with respect both to lands and tithes, encreased considerably, and
were continually encouraged by the popes, the kings, the bishops, and
nobility; by the popes for the reason already given; by the bishops and
nobility, who were all Normans or foreigners, out of partiality to their
countrymen (for such the monks generally were) and out of contempt and
hatred to the secular clergy, who were universally English; by the kings,
not only for this last mentioned cause, but for another peculiar to themselves.
The government of the Saxon kings was remarkably moderate,
and their laws and constitutions extremely favourable to the liberties of the
people. The first race of Norman kings pretended, indeed, a right to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
throne, and every one of them swore to observe the Saxon laws, with such
emendations as had been consented to in parliament by William the First.
But the conduct of every one of them shewed how little regard they had to
that obligation, and how bent they were on setting themselves free from
all restraint, and to destroy all traces of the old Saxon laws. For this purpose
it was absolutely necessary to depress the secular clergy; who, in those
times of ignorance, were the only lawyers; insomuch, that, in William the
Second’s reign, it was said, <i>nullus clericus, nisi causidicus</i>; and, to render
them unfit guardians of those privileges, the kings were resolved to trample
upon them. For this end, a new language and new forms of proceeding
were introduced into the courts, the secular and ecclesiastical jurisdictions,
which had been united, were separated; and the clergy were banished
from the temporal courts, and the greatest part of the business which formerly
had been transacted in the country courts was transferred to the <i>curia
regis</i>, under the immediate inspection of his judges<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus were the secular clergy daily reduced in circumstances and importance,
while the monasteries flourished on their downfall. However, about
the time of Henry the Third (for it is hard precisely to fix when it became
an allowed maxim of the English law) all tithes arising in any parish were,
of common right, payable to the priest of that parish, unless they had been
previously appropriated to some other priest, or monastery, either by a positive
appropriation appearing, or by prescription where that was lost, and
that no layman could prescribe against the payment of them. I say no layman,
for with respect to ecclesiastics, the case was otherwise. It had, indeed,
been a controversy in France several centuries before, whether the
lands of a church or monastery should pay tithes to the parish minister
where they lay; but it was determined by the better opinion that they
should. However the bishops of Rome, in complaisance to their friends
the Monks, granted to many monasteries an exemption from tithes for their
lands. And these are the lands, which we see at this day in the hands of
laymen discharged of tithes, by virtue of a statute in the reign of Henry the
eighth; before I proceed to which, it will be proper to take notice of what
a <i>modus</i> is, as they were introduced in those early times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>A modus, then, is a composition for tithes in kind, within a certain district;
whereby the layman is discharged from rendering his tithes, on his
paying to the parson, in lieu thereof, what the local custom of that place
directs. These compositions were originally for the mutual benefit of the
clergy and laity; that one might have a settled certainty what to receive,
and the other what to pay; and was, while the equivalent continued to
bear any reasonable proportion to the value, an excellent means to prevent
yearly disputes between the minister and his flock; but as most of them are
fixed at certain rates of money, the change of its value hath, in all these
cases, greatly impoverished the parochial clergy, especially as many of them
grew up into a prescription, by the negligence of the clergy, without an
original composition. These <i>moduses</i> have, likewise, not a little hurt the
spiritual jurisdiction; for as their courts paid little or no regard to them, as
being against the canon law, if the original composition did not appear to
have the bishop’s authority, by being found in his registry, the temporal
courts, wherever one is pleaded, send a prohibition to the ecclesiastical one,
and reserve the tryal to themselves, by a jury of twelve men, as the legal
judges of the custom<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<p>When Henry the eighth threw off the pope’s supremacy, great was his
danger both from abroad, and at home, particularly from the monasteries.
A resolution therefore was taken for suppressing them, and applying their
revenues to more useful purposes. The intention of Cranmer, at least, was
to restore the tithes to the parochial clergy, and out of some part of the
lands to found new bishopricks, and for other religious and charitable purposes;
the remainder to be united to the royal demesnes to enable him to defend
his realm without burthening his subjects with subsidies. But little of
this kind was done. Five or six bishopricks, with very poor revenues, were
erected, and the rest, both of lands and tithes, were distributed to the laity
in whose hands they still remain, partly out of present political views,
but principally from the extravagance of that king and the indigence of his
successors, concurring with the avarice of their courtiers. As to the lands
the abbots held discharged of tithes, the parish ministers right to them would,
by the common law of England, have revived as soon as they got into lay-hands;
as it would have done before, if the abbot had aliened with the consent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of the convent, and this was the case of the lands of the lesser monasteries.
But when the greater ones were dissolved by the act of 31st of Henry
the eighth, it was expressly provided, that the king and his grantees should
enjoy those lands, discharged from tithes, in as ample a manner, as the abbots
held them before that time. Thus became a great part of the tithes of
the kingdom, which by the common law of England were the legal maintenance
of the parochial clergy, lay fees, and inheritances, as they continue
at this day<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p>Tithes are of three kinds, <i>prædial</i>, <i>personal</i> or <i>mixed</i>. Prædial, are the
fruits arising immediately from the ground, as all sorts of grain, hay, underwoods,
fruits of trees, hops, saffron, hemp, flax, and such like. Mixed,
which arise from cattle nourished by the ground as their young, colts, calves,
lambs, pigs, or their productions, as milk, cheese, butter, &amp;c. Thirdly,
personal, which arise from the labour and industry of men using any merchandize,
or manual occupation, and is the tenth part of their clear gain.</p>

<p>The two first had their foundation in the law of Moses, the last was introduced
and strongly inforced by the canon law; nay so shameless were some
of the canonists, as to insist that harlots were obliged to pay the tenth of their
infamous gains; but this latter kind has had little effect in England, except
by the local customs of some particular places<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p>As to what things are tithable or not by our law, it may not be amiss to
lay down some general maxims concerning them.</p>

<p>First then, as to prædial tithes: Regularly, they are due only out of
things that encrease annually, <i>simul &amp; semel</i>, and therefore except by special
custom, mines, minerals, chalks, stones, slates, turfs, being part of the soil,
and not increasing annually, are not tithable; but this rule admits of some
exceptions, of which I shall just mention two. Saffron, which encreases
from three years to three years, is yet tithable; and so is underwood, that
is, all trees cut under twenty years growth. The tithes of trees occasioned
many contests between the clergy and laity in England, the one exacting it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
by their canons, and the commons in parliament constantly remonstrating
against it. At length it was settled by parliament, that none should be
exempted but timber above twenty years growth, as being fit for building.
But this statute is so constructed, that if the trees be not of the nature of
timber, they are tithable, though above that age, as bush, birch, and the
like; but these, if for the scarcity of other timber, they are used in building,
as beech is in Buckinghamshire, they are there exempted.</p>

<p>As to mixed tithes, the rule is, that things <i>feræ naturæ</i> are not tithable.
Therefore fish, pheasants, partridges, rabbits, deer, bees, and such like
are not; but several of these, if reclaimed, have been adjudged to be so, as
bees in a hive, and the same reason holds as to pigeons in a dove house;
though the opinion of common lawyers is, that they are not tithable, if
spent in the house, and not used for sale.</p>

<p>But what shall we say for barren cattle, from whom no yearly profit
arises? Shall the parson receive no benefit whatever from them, and shall it
lie in the power of the occupier, by employing all his land in feeding nothing
but barren cattle, to leave his minister without support? Certain it is,
whatever the modern practice and opinion may be, that by the best authorities
of the antient lawyers, <i>agistment</i> was due to the clergy which was the
tenth part of the value of the lands, or the twentieth, which by custom, in
most places, was generally paid, if the proprietor depastured the whole year,
or less, according to the time and quantity of the cattle, saddle horses, or
cattle for the plough, only excepted<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for the history and general rules of tithes, the
second species of incorporeal rights, to which I may add, as much of the
same nature, and founded on the same reason, what is called <i>ministers money</i>
out of houses, in cities and towns, where there are no tithes, which the act
of parliament, of the 17th and 18th of Charles the second, hath restrained
to the twentieth part of the value of houses, as valued by a commission from
the Lord Lieutenant and six of the council.</p>

<p><i>The right of Seignory and its consequences—The right of Reversion—Rent seck—Rent
charge—The nature of</i> distress, <i>as the remedy for recovering feudal
duties. Observations on</i> distresses <i>in general</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Having spoken of tithes and advowsons, two kinds of incorporeal
benefices that arose in those antient times, I come now to treat of
<i>seignories</i> and their consequences. A seignory is an incorporeal right and
interest still remaining in the lord, when he parts with his lands, in benefice
to a tenant. Now the rights of a lord, in respect of his seignory, may be
considered in two ways, either as the services were due to the lord from
the <i>person</i> of the tenant, or from the <i>lands</i>. He hath therefore, in virtue
of his seignory, a right to all those personal duties which flow impliedly from
the oath of fealty; such as to receive warning from his tenants of any injury
done, or impending danger to his person, his dignity, or seignory, to receive
faithful advice from them when called upon, and to have his secrets faithfully
kept by them; to be the judge of their controversies, and the leader in war
of such of them as hold by military service. For these barbarous people
had no idea of dividing power, but always entrusted the civil and military
sword in the same hands; whereby they avoided the dangers and disorders
that more polished and richer nations have ever been exposed to, namely,
of having the civil and legal authority subverted by the military power.
And so strict was the bond between lord and tenant, that the latter could in
no wise, in point of judgment, decline his lord’s jurisdiction, by refusing him
as judge on account of partiality. Such a charge was a breach of fealty on
the vassal’s part, and no such presumption could be admitted by that law,
which looked upon the lord as equally bound by the oath of fealty, though
not taken by him, as the tenant was<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.</p>

<p>By the Roman law, a suspected judge might be refused by the suitors for
almost all the same causes, and grounded mostly upon the same reasons, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
which jurors, who in our law are <i>judges of the fact</i>, may be challenged at this
day. But the feudal customs admitted no such suspicions as to the lord, and
therefore in the English law, no judge, however clearly interested in the
cause, can be challenged. This maxim once established, it was necessary,
however, for the sake of justice, that it should admit of some qualification.
The <i>assessors</i> in Germany, who assisted the lord in judgment, from whom
came, in after time, the <i>pares curiæ</i>, were this qualification. But as these
were not judges in all feudal causes, but in some the lord alone continued
sole judge; some remedy was here to be applied, and on the continent and
in England, they proceeded differently. On the continent, the king, or superior
lord, appointed a <i>cojudge</i>, or assessor. In England the suitor, by applying
to the king’s courts was empowered to remove the cause thither;
which hath been one great occasion of these inferior courts of the lords
dwindling to nothing<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the right the lord had in the land by virtue of his seignory, the
principal, and upon which his other rights out of the land depended, was
his <i>reversion</i>. A reversion is that right of propriety remaining in the lord,
during the continuance of the particular estate of possession of the tenant;
whereby he is entitled to the service during the duration of the term, and
to the possession itself, when it is either expired, or forfeited. Hence it
appears that the fealty and services of the tenant are incident to the lord’s
reversion. Out of these reversions may be carved another incorporeal
estate, called a <i>remainder</i>, which is a particular estate dependant upon, and
consequent to a prior particular estate; as if lands be granted to A. for five
years, and afterwards to B. for life. In this case A. hath a lease for years,
B. a remainder for life, and the reversion remains in the grantor. In our
law, remainders, and the particular precedent estate on which they depend
are considered as making but one estate; and so, in truth, they are with
respect to the reversioner, though not to each other. Therefore they must
both pass out of the grantor at the same time, though it is not absolutely
necessary that the remainder should vest in the grantee at the creation of the
precedent particular estate; for a remainder may be good which depends on a
contingency, as if a remainder, after a lease for life or years to A, is limited
to the eldest son of J. S. This is a good remainder, but a contingent one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
depending on the birth of J. S.’s son during the continuance of the term of
A; for the remainder being but one estate with the precedent particular
one, and only a continuation of it, must commence instantly when it determines.
Or, if after a lease to A, a remainder is limited to the heirs of
J. S. this is a good contingent remainder, depending on the event of J. S.
dying during the particular estate. For it is a maxim of the English law,
<i>Nemo est hæres viventis</i>.</p>

<p>To return to reversions, I mentioned fealty and services as incidents of a
reversion; but we must distinguish that fealty is an inseparable one, which
the services are not; for the tenure being from the reversioner, and fealty
necessarily incident to every tenure, it is impossible they should be separated.
A grant, therefore, of fealty, without the reversion, is void; and the
grant of the reversion carries the fealty with it. But the case is otherwise as
to the services; for the services may be granted without the reversion, and
although the reversion be granted, the services, by special words, may be
excepted<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be now proper to speak of the remedy the reversioner hath for the
recovery of his services, if they are not paid. In the antient times the tenant
was, at all the due times, at his peril obliged to perform his service;
for as each the smallest failure was a breach of his fealty, his tenancy was
thereby absolutely forfeited, and this long continued to be the case in military
tenures. But as the defence of the realm was not concerned in the
socage holdings, but only the immediate interest of the lord, it was thought
too hard, that every, perhaps involuntary omission, should induce an absolute
forfeiture; when the lord, where his dues were certain, might receive
an adequate recompence. Custom, then, introduced the method of <i>distress</i>,
in imitation of the Roman law, as the proper method to recover an equivalent
for the damages he sustained by the non-performance of the duties.
And afterwards, when the personal service of the military tenants came to
be commuted into a sum of money called <i>escuage</i>, distress came to be the
regular method of recovering that and the other fruits of the military tenure;
the damage the lord sustained being now capable of a reduction to a certainty<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>The introduction of distress on socage tenants was thus: When the absolute
forfeiture was thought too severe, the first step was, that the lord
should enter, and hold the lands till his tenant had satisfied him as to his
damages; but as this seizure frequently disabled the tenant from making
that satisfaction, especially if he had no other lands, this, after some time,
was thought still too rigorous, and in its stead was substituted the seizure of
the cattle, and other moveables found on the land, and the detention of
them as a pledge, until the damages were answered; which is what we call
<i>distraining</i>. This was a sufficient security to the lord, as it rarely happened
but that there was sufficient found to answer his demand for one failure; and
the tenant was not (as not being deprived of his possession) reduced to an
incapacity of paying his rent of services, and thereby recovering his pledges.
Hence all feudal rents, or, as our law calls them, <i>rent services</i>, (being
the service the tenant pays to the lord, in consideration of the land he
holds from him) are distrainable<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.</p>

<p>But there was another species of rents in our law not distrainable; which,
therefore was called <i>redditus siccus</i>, or <i>rent seck</i>. This was not a feudal service,
not being paid from a tenant to his lord, and was thus: When a
man, keeping still his land in himself, grants a rent thereout to a stranger,
the grantor is justly bound by his grantee; but the grantee, not being his
lord, cannot have this remedy. For the remedy of distress being substituted
in the place of the lord’s right of entry, could not be extended to a
stranger, who never had that right. And this was originally the only kind
of rent seck; but the statute called <i>quia emptores terrarum</i>, introduced another
species of rents not distrainable, by converting rent services into rents
seck. The liberty of alienation without the consent of the lords having been
allowed before that statute, it became customary for a tenant who sold his
land, and parted with his whole estate in it, to reserve the tenure of the
<i>vendee</i>, not to his superior lord and his heirs, but to himself and his heirs;
whereby he retained many advantages to himself, by continuing the vendee’s
lord, such as the right of escheat, if the tenant died without heirs, and the
benefit of the wardship and marriage, if it was held by knight’s service.
Now a rent reserved upon such a sale to the vender, was, as he continued
the vendee’s lord, a rent service, and consequently distrainable<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>But this practice, though highly useful to the sellers, was of considerable
detriment, not only to their lords, who thereby frequently lost the fruits of
their tenures, but indeed to the whole military policy of the kingdom. It
was enacted, therefore, in the eighteenth of Edward the First, by the statute
above mentioned, that whenever a man aliened his whole estate, the
alienee should not hold from him, and be his tenant, but from the superior
lord, and be the lord’s tenant directly; and that by the same services, by
which the alienor had holden. The alienor, then, by this statute, ceasing to
be lord, and his right of reversion clearly gone, if he reserves a rent on such
alienation, he cannot distrain for it, and it is a rent seck.</p>

<p>These rents seck, therefore, were of two kinds, one arising by grant,
which was the most antient, the other by reservation, when a man aliened
his whole estate. For if the whole estate was not gone, but a reversion
remained in him, a rent reserved was still, on account of that reversion,
a rent service; as if A. gave lands to B. and the heirs of his body, reserving
rent. As this estate tail, although it might continue for ever, yet
was capable of determination by the failure of that issue, such rent was distrainable,
for that reason, and also because, by the statute which gave
force to such estates tail, the reversion was saved to the donor. But if he
had made a lease of life or years, or a gift in tail, and had, at the same
time, conveyed over the remainder in fee, so that his reversion was gone, a
rent reserved on such a grant was <i>seck</i>.</p>

<p>The inconvenience attending these rents seck, in their not being distrainable,
introduced another species of rents called <i>rent charges</i>. These are
rents seck, armed with a power of distress by the special agreement of the
parties; and are of two kinds, as the former are created either by <i>grant</i>,
or <i>reservation</i>. Those by grant, which were the only species of rent charges
before the statute, were thus; as if I grant out of my lands, keeping them
still in myself, a rent for years, life, fee tail, or fee simple, and give my
grantee a power to enter and distrain for the rent. It will be by reservation;
if I reserve to myself a rent upon a conveyance in fee simple, or upon a gift
in tail with a remainder over in fee, or upon a lease for life or years, with a
remainder over in fee, and it is covenanted that I shall have a right to enter
and distrain for the rent. The power of distress, therefore, in rent charges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
is good only by the express provision of the parties, not by the force of the
general law<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>Antiently it was a doubt whether a rent charge could be reserved upon
a <i>deed poll</i>; to understand which, it will be necessary to explain the difference
between a <i>deed poll</i> and an <i>indenture</i>. A deed poll is a grant from one man
to another, and is all and every part of it the act and words of the grantor
only; and therefore the deed belongs to the grantee, and there is no counterpart
in the hands of the grantor; because the grantee binds himself to
nothing towards him. Whereas, in an indenture, every clause is the act
and words of both. They are mutually bound to each other, and therefore
there is a counterpart in the hands of each party. Now if A. by deed poll,
granted lands in fee to B. reserving rent, with a clause of distress, it was
doubted whether this clause was not void, and the rent a rent seck; because
as the lands by A’s grant was in B. it was apprehended they could not
be charged with it without an express covenant from him; as in the deed
poll he was a party merely passive. But it is now held, and that very equitably,
that such a reservation can raise a good rent-charge; for his acceptance
of the deed upon the delivery is an act sufficient to shew his assent to
take it on the terms therein contained; and nothing can be more reasonable
than that whosoever takes a benefit shall take it under such conditions, and
no other than such as the donor intended.</p>

<p>Thus have I endeavoured to explain the nature of the three several kinds
of rents in our law, of which only rent service is properly feudal; but upon
account of the affinity of their nature, I thought proper to join them here.
It will be proper now to say something concerning the nature of <i>distress</i>, as it
was the remedy for recovering the feudal duties in these kingdoms.</p>

<p>Distresses were not only taken for rents, and other services reserved,
but also to oblige persons to appear in courts of justice, or to raise fines, and
amerciaments inflicted on them. This likewise arose from the feudal law,
as by that the doing suit and service at the lord’s court was one of the duties
attendant on fealty.</p>

<p>But there is another kind of distress allowed by our law, arising neither
from the feudal contract, nor the express stipulation of the parties, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
from the <i>delictum</i>, or negligence of a stranger. It is called a <i>distress for damage
feasant</i>, and is a seizure of the cattle, or any other moveable of a
stranger, trespassing upon or damaging my ground. The law in this case
will not put me to my action against the proprietor, whom perhaps I may
never discover; but has provided a <i>festinum remedium</i> for me, by way of
distress; and this distress is more privileged than others, for it may be
taken in the night-time, which other distresses cannot; because, otherwise,
the cattle might escape, and the goods be removed, and so the party injured
remain without remedy.</p>

<p>Many and grievous were the extortions and oppressions of the antient
English lords in their taking distresses, during the troublesome reign of Henry
the Third, for the remedying which many wise regulations were made by
the statute of Marlebridge and others. For they not only distrained in a
most unreasonable manner for the smallest duties, but distrained where nothing
was due; and frequently even out of their fees; and to deprive the
parties injured of legal remedy, drove them into another county, or inclosed
them in a castle, or would not suffer their bailiffs to permit a replevin<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

<p>Since I am on this head of distresses, it will be proper to make a few
observations, <i>what</i> may be legally distrained, <i>when</i>, and <i>where</i>, and <i>how</i> a
distress is to be demeaned, and what remedy the person wrongfully distrained
hath to recover his property.</p>

<p>First then, nothing can be distrained but moveables, and such as may
be restored in the same plight. For the distress is in the nature of a pledge
to be restored on due satisfaction made; therefore nothing fixed to the freehold
is distrainable, as doors, windows, furnaces, &amp;c. for these being affixed
thereto, are part of the freehold, and cannot be separated thence
without damage. Therefore, a smith’s anvil, though not actually fixed, or
a millstone removed in order to be picked, are not subject to distress; for
the one is, in law, still part of the shop, as the other is of the mill. Hence,
likewise, money is not distrainable, unless it be in a bag; because, otherwise,
it cannot be known, so as to return it in the same plight. For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
same reason, by the old law, corn in sheaves, or in stacks, or in a barn, or
hay in cocks, or in a loft, could not, for fear of damage in removing.
That however hath been since altered by statute, but corn or hay on a cart
could be distrained by the old law; for they being, in such a case, found in
a situation fit for removal, might be transported from place to place without
any probable danger of damage, or diminution.</p>

<p>Secondly, The instruments of a man’s livelihood, as the tools of a tradesman,
the books of a scholar, the plough-cattle of a ploughman, &amp;c. cannot
be distrained where any other distress is to be found; and this for the
particular safety and benefit of individuals. But this holds not in the case
of <i>damage feasant</i>; for there the identical thing that did the trespass, and
that only, must answer for it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Things sent to public places of trade are privileged, for the
public benefit of the realm, as cattle in a market, corn sent to a mill, cloth
in a taylor’s shop, yarn in a weaver’s house. For it would put a total stop
to commerce if these were answerable for the rents of such places.</p>

<p>Fourthly, What is in the custody of law is not distrainable, for it would
be an absurdity that a man should have a right by law, to take things out of
the custody of the law itself, such as goods already distrained, or goods taken
in execution, or seized by process at the suit of the king.</p>

<p>Fifthly, Things in manual possession of another, are, for the time,
privileged, as an ax in a man’s hand, or the horse I ride on. But for
damage feasant, as I said before, every thing is distrainable; for the thing
itself which did the damage, is the pledge of the satisfaction, and the only
one.</p>

<p>Next let us see <i>how</i> and <i>where</i> they may be taken. The distress, then,
should not be excessive, as an ox should not be taken for twelve pence,
where other sufficient distress might be had, or two sheep where one was
sufficient; but for damage feasant, though ever so little, the whole may be
taken; and likewise for homage, fealty, or the wages of members in parliament.
As the interest of the whole community is concerned in these, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
distress can be excessive. No distress can be taken in the king’s highway,
for it is privileged for the public use of the nation. Neither can any distress
be taken by night, unless for damage feasant; for as no tender of rent, or
other duty, can be made, or acceptance enforced but in the day-time, perhaps
the tenant may, in such case, be provided, and ready to tender
his duties the succeeding morning, and thereby save his chattels. Lastly,
by the common law, no man could distrain out of his fee, unless when coming
to distrain he had the view of them, and they were driven off to prevent
him. But this hath been altered by statute, and now a landlord may follow
his tenant’s cattle, if conveyed by his lessee off the land, and distrain them
within twenty days.</p>

<p>As to the <i>manner</i> of demeaning or managing the distress, it is the duty of
the distrainor to carry them to a pound, that they may be in the custody of
the law. <i>Pounds</i> are of two kinds, <i>overt</i>, or <i>covert</i>; the one for living
cattle, the other for other goods that might take damage by the weather.
The reason why living cattle should regularly be put into a pound overt, is,
that, as they are but a pledge, from which, in itself, the taker is to receive
no benefit; and as the proprietor, therefore, must be at the sole expence of
feeding them, he should have the freest access to them for that purpose; and,
in such case, if they perish, the loss is his; but if they be put into a covert
pound, there, because the owner cannot have access, the taker is to feed
them, and answer for them at his peril.</p>

<p>In antient times, the lords used to drive the distresses into foreign counties,
whereby the tenants knew not where to resort to feed their beasts. This
was forbidden by Marlebridge, cap. 4. However, that act received this
construction, that if a manor lay in two counties, and its pound in one of
them, the lord might distrain in the other county, and impound them in
his manor pound; because the tenant, by attending the manor court, was
presumed to know every thing transacted in the manor. But now, by later
acts, no distress of cattle shall be impounded out of the hundred, or barony
where taken, except in a pound overt, in the same county, within three
miles of the place; nor shall distresses be divided, and impounded in several
places. Dead chattels must be impounded likewise within three miles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
and that in a pound covert, otherwise the taker is answerable for them, if
damaged or stolen.</p>

<p>As to the <i>remedy</i> for taking an unjust distress, the tenant might, if there
was nothing due, rescue them before they were put in pound, and justify
it; but when once impounded, they were in the custody of the law, and
must be delivered by law. Or if there was any thing due, he might, before
they were impounded, make a tender of satisfaction; which, though
the caption was just, rendered the detention unlawful; and therefore if the
beasts, after such tender, were put in pound, and died there, the taker
was answerable.</p>

<p>When the goods were once impounded, the remedy was by <i>replevin</i>,
which is a judicial writ out of Chancery, directed to the sheriff, who is
Judge in this case, complaining of the unjust taking and detention, and
commanding the sheriff to deliver them back to the owner, upon security
given to make out the injustice of the taking or detention, or else to return
the goods and chattels.</p>

<p>But this method of replevin, by writ out of Chancery, was very inconvenient
to the remote parts of the kingdom; as the owner might be put to
extraordinary expence and trouble, in maintaining his cattle for a long
time. Hence it was provided, by the statute of Marlebridge, cap. 21. <i>Quod
si Averia alicujus capiantur, &amp; injuste detineantur, vicecomes post querimoniam
sibi factam, ea sine impedimento vel contradictione ejus qui dicta Averia ceperit,
deliberare possit</i><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<p>This impowered the sheriff to make replevins without writ, upon the
plaint of the plaintiff in replevin; and this he could do out of his county
court, because, as that was held only from month to month, were it otherwise,
the delay might be as great as in the case of a writ of replevin; but
then the sheriff, in order to lay the foundation of the suit, must enter the
plaint the next county court, that it may appear on the rolls thereof.</p>

<p>The sheriff’s duty then was, in the first place, to take sufficient security
<i>ad prosequendum</i>, that is, that the plaintiff should make out, in due course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
of law, the justice of his writ or plaint, that is, that the cattle or goods were
either taken, or detained unjustly. He was also to take security <i>de retorno
habendo</i>, that is, in case he failed, that he would return the same distress, that
it might be delivered to the taker; and this is by the statute of West. 2.;
and he generally, likewise, took security to indemnify himself from any
action that might be brought against him. And then it was his duty immediately
to deliver the distress to the plaintiff in replevin.</p>

<p>Then it lies on the taker or defendant in replevin to <i>avow</i>, that is, to set
forth the reasons of his caption, to which the plaintiff replies; and so the
justice of the cause comes into question, to be legally determined. Thus
much is sufficient, at the present, to shew the remedy the lord hath for his
services, by virtue of his seignory, and how his tenant is to defend himself
if unjustly distressed<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<p>I might here treat of another fruit of the lord’s seignory, which is the
<i>right of escheat</i>, or the lands falling back to the lord, either for the <i>delictum</i>
of the tenant, or the failure of blood; but as, to understand this last properly,
we must know who are inheritable, it will be more proper to defer
it till after we have treated of <i>inheritances</i>.</p>

<p><i>The manner in which estates for life came to be enlarged into descendible estates—The
nature of Reliefs—Feudal oppressions—The admission of allodial lands
into the feudal policy—The extension of the feudal system in France.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The feudal lands having been changed by degrees from tenancies for
years into permanent grants for life, partly by the necessities, and
partly by the favour of the lords, the matter did not stop here; but, to the
advantage of the vassals, their rights were continually gaining ground, and
insensibly extending themselves, to a durable continuance in the same family.
To this, undoubtedly, the number of allodial estates, which were estates of
inheritance in the hands of the Romans, greatly contributed. For it is not
to be imagined that it could be an agreeable spectacle to the conquerors,
when once they were settled, and secured in the possession of the country,
to behold their posterity in a more precarious situation, with regard to property,
than the vanquished were. It is true, as by their constitution the
lord was obliged to provide every gentleman, that is, every one of their nation,
unless he proved unworthy, with a benefice, there was no danger of
their issue not being supplied, in some degree or other. But this did not satisfy
them<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.</p>

<p>Their roving manner of life being antiquated, and the practice of removing
them from place to place every year being superseded by gifts for
life, the possessors, by habitude, became fond of their dwellings, and no
longer contented with bare necessaries, studied to render their situation
commodious and agreeable. They built houses of strength and convenience,
and by their socage, tenants and villains planted and improved their
lands. And now it began to be thought severe, that the benefit of their
improvements, and the fruit of their and their dependants toil and labour,
should go to strangers, or even to the lord himself. For before this time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
it had began, and was now grown into a common practice, for the lords,
when they gave an estate for life, not to content themselves merely with
future service, but to exact, at the time of their investiture, an <i>honorary fine</i>
from the tenant; and this, being but moderate, was generally complied
with, in order to gain a permanent estate. The interest of the state, which
was concerned in the improvement of particulars, required also a preference
of the defendants of those that made them. It is no wonder, therefore,
that it grew to be a maxim, and universal opinion among these people, that
the not continuing the son in the possession of his deceased father, though it
was in the lord’s power to remove him, was a great hardship, and an unworthy
act in the lord<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

<p>With these general sentiments, the lords, for their own interest, were
obliged to comply, and especially the kings; who, by the frequent divisions
of the monarchy in France, had competitors to guard against; and were,
therefore, enforced to attach their vassals to them in the strongest manner,
by complying with their inclinations. The sons, therefore, or one of them,
generally succeeded; not in virtue of any inherent right, but by a new gift,
through the favour of the lord. For, upon the death of his vassal, the
estate being expired, the lord took possession, and, upon receiving a fine,
made a new grant, by investiture, as of a new estate, to such an one of the
sons as he chose; or he divided it among them at his pleasure. These fines
for continuing the fiefs in the same family were called <i>relevia</i> or <i>reliefs</i>,
from the Latin word <i>relevare</i>, which signified a second lightening, or removing
the hand of the lord, who had seized the benefice upon its vacancy,
by the death of the former possessor. Hence the son had no right to continue
his father’s possession. He was obliged to petition for a new investiture,
and to tender his relief, and himself ready to take the oath of fealty.
These reliefs were originally paid in arms, being the most valuable property
these military people had, and afterwards were converted into money. The
<i>quantum</i> was originally at the lord’s will; but his own interest, from the motives
already hinted, commonly prevented him from being exorbitant.
This preference to a succession being at first a matter of favour, not of right,
some vassals, by degrees, obtained of their lord, in their investitures, an absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
right of succession to their sons; which bound the lord and his heir;
and that in these two different manners. It was either by a grant to the
vassal, and one or more of his sons by name; and then those omitted were
excluded; or <i>to him and his sons</i> generally; and then, by the feudal law
abroad, they were all admitted to enjoy in equal portions, in imitation of
the Roman law, which admits all the children in that manner.</p>

<p>But the words of the grant were not extended, by a favourable construction,
to take in grandsons by the name of sons, for the following reason.
When a grant was made to a man and one or more of his sons by name, the
sons were originally, at the time of the investiture, capable, or supposed capable,
by the lord’s admission, of doing the services of the feud; and their
ability and merit was in the contemplation of the grantor, and part of the
consideration of the grant; and where it was given to a man and his sons
generally, the law presumed the same thing, the same capacity in them, the
same intention in the grantor. But in the case of grandfather and grandson,
the law could not presume so, it being contrary to the ordinary course of
nature, that both should, at the time of investiture, be capable of doing the
services in person; and therefore the grandsons, unless specially provided
for, were excluded<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus a right of succession for one step was gained by the express provision
of the parties, in particular cases. But as the lord, where he continued
the succession out of favour, entered into the lands, and parted not with
them without payment of his relief by the son, it was reasonable in this case,
where he positively bound himself, that these advantages should be reserved
to him. Therefore the heir could not enter, but was obliged to petition his
lord <i>humiliter</i> and <i>devotè</i>, and to offer his fealty and relief; and the interest
of the lord and of the state requiring the place of the deceased vassal to be
speedily filled up, a year’s and a day’s time was allowed for this application;
within which space, if the heir did not apply, unless prevented by inevitable
necessity, he forfeited his right of succession, and the lord was at liberty to
dispose of it to a stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Reliefs, however, being, in their original creation, arbitrary, it should
seem to be in the power of the lord, where the quantity was not specified in
the tenor of the investiture, to defeat his own grant, by demanding, under
that name, more than the value of the land, or otherwise grievously to distress
his tenant. This, in England particularly, occasioned many struggles.
It appears from the laws of William the Conqueror, that, in those times,
the reliefs were fixed according to the different ranks of the persons, and
paid in horses and armour, in imitation of heriots in the Saxon times; but
his avaricious and tyrannical son William Rufus laid claim to, and exacted
arbitrary reliefs, to the great discontent of all, and to the impoverishment of
many of his subjects<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. This was redressed in Henry the First’s charter,
where the first chapter says, <i>Si quis baronum, comitum, sive aliorum qui de me
tenent mortuus fuerit, heres suus non redimet terram suam sicut faciebat tempore
fratris mei, sed legitima, &amp; certa relevatione relevabit eam, similiter &amp; homines
baronum meorum, legitima, &amp; certa relevatione relevabunt terras suas de dominis
suis</i><a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. Henry the First, however, was a man little inclined to keep any engagements
with his people that he could free himself from; and therefore
reliefs went on in an arbitrary way, for the most part, under him, though
not in so oppressive and extorting a manner as his brother William had used.
For in his grandson Henry the Second’s reign, in whose time the feudal
payments became generally converted into money, we find, from Glanville,
that the relief of a knight’s fee, indeed, was reduced to a certainty, but
that of a noble fee was not. <i>Dicitur autem rationabile relevium alicujus, juxta
consuetudinem regni, de feodo unius militis, centum solidos;—de baroniis vero nihil
certum statutum est, quia juxta voluntatem &amp; misericordiam domini regis solent
baroniæ capitales de releviis suis domino regi satisfacere<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.</i></p>

<p>It seems a little odd, that the lower military people had got such an advantage
above the great and powerful lords; but this may be accounted for
from the number of the knights, who made the strength of the kingdom,
and were not to be disobliged; and also from the precarious situation many
of the great lords were in, who had been attached to the cause of Stephen.
However, the wisdom and moderation of this great prince was such, that we
find no complaints on this head, during his reign, or that of his son Richard;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
but when John ascended the throne, a prince who hated, and was hated by
his nobles, the old oppressions were renewed, and aggravated to such a degree,
that the remedying thereof is the first article of temporal concern in
Magna Charta<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

<p>There it is provided, <i>Si quis comitum, vel baronum nostrorum, sive aliorum
tenentium de nobis in capite per servitium militare, mortuus fuerit, &amp; cum decesserit,
heres ejus plenæ ætatis fuerit &amp; relevium nobis debeat, habeat hereditamentum
suum per antiquum relevium; scilicet, heres, vel heredes comitis de comitatu
integro per centum libras, heres vel heredes baronis de baronia integra per
centum marcas; heres vel heredes militis de feodo militis integra per centum solidos
ad plus: Et qui minus habuerit minus det, secundum antiquam consuetudinem
feodorum</i><a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. And now were all reliefs reduced to a certain sum of money,
namely, the fourth part of what was then reckoned the value of the
inheritance; for a knight’s fee was then reckoned at twenty pounds, a barony
at four hundred marks, and an earldom at four hundred pounds per
annum. And by the gradual sinking of the value of money, and the rising
of lands, these payments continuing the same, came in a few centuries to be
not the twentieth part of the value. We see by the words <i>per antiquum relevium,
&amp; secundum antiquam consuetudinem feodorum</i>, how careful the lords
were to have this certainty of relief acknowledged as their antient right,
and not to accept it as a concession from the crown. When the military
lords began, in imitation of the estates they themselves had, to grant inheritances
to their socage tenants, they likewise exacted, in the nature of a relief,
from every new possessor a year’s value; or, in other words, the rent of the
first year was doubled. For a year’s value was what was, in France, at the
beginning, paid for military tenures, by the name of <i>rachat</i>, or <i>repurchase</i>,
answering to our relief, until at length they were reduced to a certainty in
money; and, consequently, from the same causes as in England, though remaining
nominally the same, they sunk to be very inconsiderable<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.</p>

<p>Estates of succession, as I observed, arose first from private grants, and
that for one generation only; but they were continually extending to further
lengths, and encreasing in number; insomuch that, fiefs falling vacant
much seldomer than before, the king had it not in his power to gratify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
his deserving soldiers so frequently as he should, and the crown was consequently
enfeebled. This then started the notion of such grants being
good only during the life of the king or lord who made them, and not
binding on his successors. Upon this plan, Brunechild, in her regency,
during the minority of her infant son, attempted to revoke them, and actually
did revoke several; which at length raised that flame, and caused that
revolution, in which her son and herself miserably perished. What shews
the violent indignation her venturing on this step occasioned, was the horrid
manner of her death, that of being torn asunder by four wild horses. Clothair
the Second, who succeeded, was wise enough by law to confirm these
estates; and then, namely about the year 613, the former doubt was removed,
and all these estates of inheritance confirmed to continue against the
successor, according to the terms of the original investiture. New grants
were continually made, and for more generations than had been formerly
practised. But yet this rule of descent was not general; but all grants, unless
heirs were specially named, were but for life; as it is in our law, in
which a <i>feofment to a man for ever</i>, is but an estate for life for want of words
of inheritance<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p>

<p>What greatly contributed to the extending these grants to indefinite generations,
was the inclination that now seized the Romans and Gauls who
held allodial lands to be admitted into the feudal policy, by becoming vassals
to the king. They had long lain under very humiliating distinctions.
They were no members of the state. The loss of their lives, and other injuries,
were compensated only by half the satisfaction to a Frank. For neglect,
or contumacy, when called into the king’s courts, they were reputed guilty,
and forfeited their estates; whereas a Frank was only imprisoned to oblige
him to answer. When accused of the lightest crimes, they were put to the
ordeal; whereas the Franks were only subjected thereto in case of murder.
And many other were the distinctions between the allodial and feudal tenants.
No wonder then the former were very desirous of enrolling themselves
among the conquerors, which when they had at length obtained,
their liberty was effected, by their giving their allodial lands, or a part of
them, to the king, and receiving them back, subject to the feudal rules.
Now were they immediate vassals of the king, and, as such, became Franks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
to all intents and purposes. But these people were not so foolish, nor could
it be expected from them, to part with absolute inheritances, and take back
only an estate for life. They insisted upon grants for a perpetuity, at least
for as long as the issue male of the person resigning lasted. When once
these donations were become common, we may be assured the Franks were
very ready to follow the example, and to take all advantages either of the
favour, or the weakness of their kings; and to such a number did these inheritances
increase, that, about the year 730, the kingdom was near being
lost to the Saracens, for want of a sufficient number of beneficiary or life-estates,
to encourage the soldiery<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p>At the time the kings of France were merely nominal, and the whole
administration in the hands of the <i>maires du palais</i>, of whom the second,
who had obtained this unlimited authority, Charles Martel, was so happy
as to save the kingdom from those African invaders in a battle near Tours,
wherein they were routed with a slaughter almost incredible. It remained
to reward the victorious soldiers, who were at least as much animated to
their exploits by his previous promises, as by their affection to the antient
constitution of the state, which was now in truth destroyed, the kings of the
royal race being mere phantoms, whose names he and his father had made
use of at their pleasure. But this family had not acquired sufficient weight
and authority to act as masters. The fund of lands, out of which benefices
had been formerly given, was almost exhausted, and the major part of
the lands that were not still allodial, was alienated either in perpetuity to the
church, as atonements for the vices of the former kings, or what was near
a perpetuity to the lords, for many descents. These last he could not despoil.
They were too firmly established by custom and law; and he and all
his predecessors had paved their way to greatness, by supporting these hereditary
grants at the expence of the crown. Necessity therefore obliged
him to make free with the lands of the church; for which, in their visions,
they lodged him in a chamber, the very lowest in hell. Of these lands the
greatest part he converted into benefices of the antient kind, for life only;
and by means of the number of those new ones, added, to the old ones, that
were in the same state, some kind of a balance was formed; which for a
time supported the government, and checked the growth of inheritances.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
But it is remarkable, that, of those church lands, several he gave as allodial
ones. I will not pretend to say, that, in this distinction, he considered the
antient nature of the lands of the church, some of which came from feudal,
others from allodial proprietors. It seems rather probable, as the allodial
estates were greatly decreased, by being turned into fiefs of inheritance, he
was inclinable to form a kind of equality between the feudal tenants, the
beneficiaries, and the allodians; that, by managing them, he might advance
his family to the title, as well as power of royalty; which we find was soon
afterwards accomplished by his son Pepin<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<p>The policy of Pepin and his son Charlemagne corresponded with Charles
Martel’s views. The former allowed the continuance of inheritances according
to the original provision in the creation, but were much fonder of
the beneficiary estates, and Charlemagne made several laws to prevent his
beneficiaries from converting by any art their interests into inheritances. In
his time, a great majority of estates were benefices; but this I presume is not
to be understood of France particularly, where, from the detail before mentioned,
it could scarce be, but of his whole empire. For in his acquisitions,
and especially in Germany, where such a practice was agreeable to the antient
customs of the natives, such a regulation was conformable to the sound
policy of his father and grandfather; by which they endeavoured to restore
the splendour of the old French monarchy, I mean with exception to the
large gifts he gave to the church on the borders of the infidels, in atonement
for his grandfather’s sacrilege, and in hopes of converting those barbarians,
and thereby civilizing them, and making them good subjects.</p>

<p>But the successors of Charlemagne had neither the power nor the understanding
of their ancestors. No wonder then, that, under them, the general
inclination of the subjects to change their benefices into fiefs gained
ground. The division of the empire, and frequent wars between the brothers,
weakened the royal authority, and strengthened their vassals; who,
at the times of their kings distress, were rather to be entreated than commanded.
In the time, therefore, of his grandsons, we find laws, that, conforming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
to the inclination of the vassals, did in time put an end to beneficiary
estates, holden from the king; opened the gate to <i>subinfeudations</i>, and
all its extensive consequences; and raised a new kind of polity never before
seen in the world, the <i>feudal</i> one, such as it reigned about the year 1050
on the continent, and was introduced into England by William the Conqueror<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>I speak of the times of Charles the Bald, who reigned about 860. One
of his laws gave leave, and an unlimited one, to the allodians, to submit
themselves and their estates, in the nature of fiefs, to others besides the
kings. Nothing could contribute more to the weakening of the royal
power, and the throwing of all the weight into the baron’s scale. Before
they could be made Franks, only by becoming the immediate vassals of
the king. This was equally for the public benefit of the state, the king, and
the allodians. But when once the barrier was thrown down, in those times
of confusion, the allodians were glad to gain the protection of the neighbouring
lords, and, under colour thereof, detached themselves from their
former subjection to the counts, who were the king’s officers over them.</p>

<p>Another law, of equal consequence, was to entitle the fee of a beneficiary,
who had only an estate for life, without any express agreement for
a longer continuance, to go to the son. This was extorted by the circumstances
of the times, and perhaps then was thought of little consequence, as
it only continued them for one generation. But the temper and general
inclination of the people were not to be controuled. Those grants that had
been so long as two generations in a family, it was sometimes dangerous,
always invidious not to continue; and thus the successors often obtained
permanent estates, when nothing less was intended at the beginning. And
this was easily obtained, as the use of letters was not common among these
people, and their charters were, by frequent rebellions, liable to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The last law I shall mention, is that declaring, that the sons of counts,
who were the king’s officers over the <i>allodianée</i>, and were originally for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
years, after for life, should succeed to their father. This put the finishing
stroke to the beneficiary estates. For though this, in appearance, was, as
the former, but for one life, and conditionally; yet, from the prevailing
principles, it was impossible they should not grow up into inheritances. And
as all inheritances were growing feudal ones, and upon those conditions,
and no others given, these counties become fiefs. The demesnes of the
crown within them became the demesnes of the count, and all the allodiaries
were now become his sub-vassals<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p>We are come to the dawn of a strictly feudal monarchy, and, to shew
the gradation, I have, in this lecture, taken in a great compass of time.
But before I proceed further downwards, it will be proper to return a little
back as to the order of time, and to speak of the consequences that attended
the introduction of estates of inheritance. Of one of these, <i>reliefs</i>, I
have already spoken in this lecture; but there are many others that must
be taken notice of.</p>

</div>

<p>Having already, in my last lecture, taken notice of <i>relief</i> which
sprung up immediately with estates of inheritance, and was their immediate
consequence, it is proper now to proceed to the other fruits of this
tenure, which grew up not so soon, but in after times: and the first to be
considered, as undoubtedly the next to relief, if not coeval with it, is <i>homage</i>;
which, Littleton says, is the most honourable service (that is with respect to
the lord, and the most humble service, that is with respect to the tenant,
that a freeholder can do to his lord) as upon the introduction of estates for
life, the ceremony of fealty was introduced, so was it thought reasonable,
when a further step was taken, that of continuing them to heirs, that a new
ceremony should be invented, distinct from the former; which being performed
publicly, in the presence of the <i>pares curiæ</i>, should, in those illiterate
ages, create a notoriety, that the tenant had a more durable estate than a
freehold. The manner of performing homage is thus distinctly described
by Littleton. When the tenant shall make homage to his lord, he shall be
ungirt, (that is, unarmed) and his head uncovered, and his lord shall sit,
and the tenant shall kneel before him on both his knees, and hold his hands
jointly together between the hands of his lord, and shall say, <i>Thus I become
your man</i> (from which word <i>homo</i>, <i>homagium</i>, and <i>hominium</i> are derived)
<i>from this day forward, of life and limb, and of earthly worship, and unto you
shall be true and faithful, and bear your faith, for the tenements that I claim to
hold of you, saving the faith that I owe to our sovereign lord the king</i>; and then
the lord so sitting shall kiss him. These are the words of Littleton, and they
are just in the case he puts of a tenant doing homage to an inferior lord, and
who had no prior lord; but if he had a prior lord, or the homage was to be
done to the king, there was a difference in the form; for if the tenant had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
former lord, he also was to be excepted, that the new lord might have notice
of the tenant’s prior obligation, and that it was not in his power to do
absolute personal services at all times to him. And if the homage was done
to the king, who acknowledged no superior, then the exception was entirely
omitted; but if to a subject, it was so absolutely necessary that an
omission of it was looked upon as an attempt against the royal dignity, and
done in disherison of the crown. And accordingly we find, that Edward
the First, in the sixth year of his reign, brought an action of ten thousand
pounds damages, now at least in value thirty thousand pounds, against the
bishop of Exeter, for taking homage of thirteen of his bishop’s vassals,
without the exception of the king; and, in the end, judgment was given
against the bishop<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p>Our antient authors tell us, that the lands for which the homage was
done ought to be specified in the doing homage; and the reason given is,
<i>Ne in captione homagii contingat dominum, per negligentiam, decipi, vel per errorem</i>.
But it was better to say, that it was for the benefit both of lord and
tenant, and for the information of the <i>pares curiæ</i>, who were to judge in
case of any controversy between them.</p>

<p>In England the two ceremonies of homage and fealty were kept distinct;
the homage, as being for the most durable estate, was performed first, and
afterwards the fealty; but, on the continent, at least in some countries, I
find they were blended together, by the homage being done upon oath.</p>

<p>Another difference between England and the continent was, that, in
England, no homage was repeated to the lord’s heir, by a tenant who had
himself performed it to the ancestor, but homage once from the tenant was
sufficient for his life; whereas, in France, new homage by the same tenant
was done on the death of the lord, as we may see plainly by many instances,
in the case of the kings of England and France, for the lands the former
held in the latter country. Homage was the symbol of a strict and indissoluble
bond between the bloods of the lord and tenant, by which they,
and the heirs of their blood, were mutually disabled from doing any thing to
the prejudice of the other party. The tenant, therefore, could not alien,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
either by last will or by deed, in his life-time, without the previous consent
of the lord. This maxim was established partly in favour of the blood of
the first tenant, which was, in fact, often the consideration of the original
grant, as when the lord gave lands in marriage with his daughter, or to a
son or a brother, (and even where it was not in truth so, the law presumed
the blood of the first tenant was in contemplation on the strength of this
maxim, <i>fortes creantur fortibus et bonis</i>, and the probability that a gallant
warrior would, by a proper education, qualify his son for the same profession)
and partly also in favour of the lord, that he should not be obliged to receive,
as his tenant, a person that was inexpert in war; or that, if qualified,
was, perhaps, an enemy to the lord, or that was previously vassal and bound
to another lord who was an enemy. For in those troublesome times, the
power of the crown of France, where these rules began, being greatly diminished,
every lordship made a little kind of state in itself, frequently at
open war; and when not so, at least in a state of suspicious peace with its
neighbours; and from this state of things it happened, that the word <i>feud</i>
has come in our common language, to signify a mortal quarrel, as being almost
inseparable from the greater, or even lesser fiefs<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p>In those times, the lord, when things grew into a more settled state, took
advantage of this maxim, that the tenant should not alien without licence,
and the tenants readily acquiesced, under the subsistence of the rule, as it
permitted them, in their turn, to exact a fine from their under tenants, or
the alienees of such in all cases of subalienation; by which means this fine
at length became an established fruit of tenure. In England, however, it
ceased in the case of lords that were subjects from the time of the statute
called <i>Quia emptores terrarum</i>, which gave every person a free liberty to sell
his lands: but the king not being named in that statute, according to the
well-known legal maxim, was not bound thereby; and of course was paid
fines for alienation, or by subsequent statutes a commutation for such fines
by his military tenants <i>in capite</i>, to the time of the Restoration, when these
tenures were entirely abolished. On the other hand, the lord was not permitted
to alien, even with the consent of his superior, without the consent
also of his tenant, and that for a similar reason. For if he, the lord, might so
do, he might subject his tenant to one who was the tenant’s mortal enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and perhaps for no other reason than for serving his former lord faithfully
against the new one<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>This last maxim once established, introduced the practice of tenants <i>attorning</i>
to their lords grants of the seignory. <i>Attornment</i> is an act of notoriety,
originally performed in the presence of the <i>pares curiæ</i>, signifying the
tenant’s consent, and turning over from his former lord to the new one, and
the putting him, the new one, in the seizin of his services. This, at first,
was merely voluntary in the tenant; but when, in England, free alienations
were allowed by the aforesaid act, it was not thought reasonable that it should
be in the tenant’s power to defeat his lord’s grant, by refusing to attorn.
He was therefore obliged, by an action called <i>Quid juris clamat</i>, to appear,
and to shew forth what title he had in the said lands, and whether he had
any sufficient cause why he should not attorn to the grantee; and if he could
not shew any, he was obliged by the judgment of the court to attorn<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.</p>

<p>Another effect of this homage was <i>warranty</i>, which is the obligation on
the lord to defend his tenant in the lands holden of him; or, if he cannot,
to give him a recompence of equal value in other lands, our law went no
farther; but the feudal law, if the warrantor had no lands to give in exchange,
obliged him to pay the value in money. <i>Warranty</i> is derived from
the word <i>war</i>, because, in those real actions, the trial was of old by combat.
This obligation, indeed, subsided, as I have already hinted, long before
the introduction of hereditary estates; but when these hereditary estates became
common, and all the military tenures were of this sort, and estates
for lives and years were only, or for the most part, socage, these last had no
warranty annexed to them by law, but only by special agreement; and the
warranty I am now speaking of was confined to inheritances, and of those
only to such as were held by homage <i>auncestrel</i>, that is, where the tenant
and his ancestors had, from time immemorial, done homage to the lord
and his ancestors. Here, on account of the continued connection between
the blood of both families, the law obliged the lord and his heirs to warrant
the lands to the tenant and his heirs<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>The manner of taking advantage of this obligation of the lords by
voucher, which still remains in our law, (the other method by disuse being
antiquated) was shortly thus: When the tenant in possession is impleaded
for the lands by a stranger, who claims them as his inheritance, he, the tenant
appears, defends his right, and <i>vouches</i>, that is, calls in his lord to
warrant the lands to him. If the lord appears gratis, and enters into the
warranty, as he ought, if he is bound to warranty, the tenant hath no more
to do in the defence of the suit. It is the lord’s business. Against him the
stranger declares, and prosecutes the suit. He defends, and it is found
against him, either by legal trial, or default, for want of appearing; and
the judgment the court gives is, that the demandant or stranger shall
recover the lands demanded against the tenant, and that the tenant shall
recover lands of equal value from the lord, or voucher, as he is termed,
because he is <i>vocatus</i>, or called in to take upon himself the defence. If the
lord, who is to warrant, doth not appear, he is summoned till he does; or
if he appears, and will not enter gratis into the warranty, the tenant is to
shew how the person he calls in is bound to warrant; which must be either
by homage auncestrel, or by his, or his ancestors express covenant, as I
shall hereafter shew; and until this was determined, the suit of the demandant
was suspended; because as yet it was uncertain who was obliged
to defend the lands. So we see in the judgment of this kind, there were in
fact two judgments, one against the tenant, who was to give up the lands,
another against the lord, who was to give lands equal in value. But there
might be three, or more judgments, as there might be two or more vouchers.
As if there be in respect to land, A, B, and C. A, lord paramont
or superior, B <i>mesne</i>, that is, tenant to A, and to lord C; and C tenant
<i>paravaile</i>, that is, the actual possessor of the land. Here, if D, a, stranger,
brings his action against C, the tenant, who vouches his lord B the mesne,
who enters into warranty, and vouches A the lord paramont, who enters
into warranty, and fails, D recovers the lands from C, C recovers in value
from B, and B recovers in value from A, and so on, if there be more
vouchers.</p>

<p>Warranties, as I hinted before, are of two kinds, <i>warranties in law</i>
or by homage auncestrel, or by words in the deed, which the law construes
to import warranty (which stood upon a feudal footing), and <i>warranties in
deed</i>, that depend on a special covenant. These last were substituted in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
place of the former. For as by every alienation, either of the lord or tenant,
the mutual connection between the two bloods was extinguished, and warranty
by homage auncestrel consequently gone (insomuch that now, by
frequent alienations, there is no such thing left) the tenant would not attorn
to his lord’s grant when the lord aliened, nor a new tenant accept of a
grant from an old tenant of his tenancy, without an express warranty,
binding in the first case the new lord and his heirs; in the latter the old one
and his heirs. Afterwards the making of these warranties was extended to
persons between whom there was no feudal connection; as if a man aliened
lands to hold of his lord. Here the grantee held of the lord of the grantor,
not of the grantor; and therefore, as he had nothing to bind the lord to
warranty, would insist on an express warranty from the grantor and his
heirs<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.</p>

<p>One species of these warranties, namely, that which is called <i>collateral
warranties</i>, was made use of, and it was the first invention that was made
use of, to elude the statute of Edward the First, <i>De donis</i>, which gave birth
to, or rather restored to life that antient kind of feudal estate, which we
call <i>Fee tail</i>. But it must be owned this intention was both against the words
and intention of that law. A judge in his grandson’s, Edward the Third’s,
reign, says, they were wise men that made this statute, and that the king
that passed it was the wisest king that ever was in England, and both assertions
must be allowed. The nobles who made it were wise men in their generations.
For, by making effectual these gifts in tail, they secured their
estates in their families, free from any forfeitures, arising from their own
misconduct; which before their estates were liable to. But at the same time
it was a destructive law for the nation. It put the great lords of England,
who were before too powerful, in a condition, by this security of the inheritance’s
descending to the heirs, to beard and awe the crown, and it likewise
discouraged industry and commerce, which then began to rear their heads in
England. Perhaps the wisdom of the sagest of the kings of England, as
he is universally called, may by some be doubted in this, that he consented
to this act; but he was a sage king, and did wisely in consenting to it. The
barons had been so oppressed in his father’s reign, and their estates so often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
confiscated, that a mutual jealousy subsisted at that time between them
and the crown. They had been restored, because the crown was otherwise
in danger. They were jealous likewise of Edward himself, for one or two
of his actions: In short, his barons were too powerful to be refused this law,
however contrary to the interest of the crown and the lower people, and there
was more to be said in its favour, it being entirely agreeable to the feudal
principles, that he who received an estate to him and the heirs of his body,
should not have it in his power to contravene, by any act of his, the gift
of the donor. He complied therefore with a good grace; but his wisdom,
if it was seen in his complying, was farther seen, and in a stronger light, in
the construction his judges and their successors made of this act, that collateral
warranty, without an equivalent, should be a bar. However, this
was but a feeble defence against the mischiefs of entails, which every day
happened, to the weakening of the public estates, and collateral warranties,
were not on every occasion so easy to be got<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.</p>

<p>At length, in Edward the Fourth’s reign, under pretence of warranties,
and those entirely fictitious, a method was found out, under the form of
legal proceedings, to defeat estates tail, and all remainders thereon, and
that in the manner following: A, who was tenant in tail, was impleaded
by collusion, by a person who pretended to claim title to the lands antecedent
to the estate tail, and who was, in fact, the man to whom A, by his
private agreement, was to alienate it, in destruction of the estate tail. A
appears, and takes defence, but vouches to warranty B, a man who has
not a foot of land, nor is likely to have any: B very readily enters into the
warranty; and when the day comes, that he should defend the suit, makes
default; in consequence whereof, the court gives judgment, that the demandant
should recover the lands against A, and A’s lands of equal value
against B the vouchee, who hath none; and yet this was judged a good bar
to the entail, upon the possibility that B might purchase lands equivalent,
and so A, and the other persons entitled in tail, might receive satisfaction.
And that is what, under the name of a common recovery, is grown to be
one of the common assurances of the realm; and though, for about seventy
years, the justice and conscientiousness of it was disputed, yet being constantly
asserted as law by the judges, and taken notice and approved of by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
acts of parliament, it is the now most effectual bar to an estate tail. To
speak candidly about these recoveries, as to their application to this purpose,
they were notorious breaches of the statute <i>De donis</i>, under the colour
of legal proceedings. Yet what could be done? the law could not be
repealed; for all members of parliament had their estates entailed. It could
only be eluded, and both for the king and all who had not estates tail, it
was necessary it should<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>Another consequence of estates becoming hereditary, and, in respect of
military tenures, a fruit of seignory, is <i>wardship</i>, or guardianship. For it
must now frequently happen, by the death of ancestors, that estates would
descend to heirs incapable to do the service, to manage their affairs, or to
educate themselves. It was necessary, therefore, that the law should make
provision both for the doing the services, and the benefit of the heir, until
he arrived at a proper age. And the law proceeded in a different manner,
as the lands were holden either by knights service or socage; tenure, in the
first case, having in view principally the defence of the realm; in the second,
the benefit of the heir. With respect to military tenures, the time of age
was twenty-one years compleat; at which time the law presumed the heir was
qualified, both by skill and strength of body, to perform the part of a soldier.
At this age, therefore, he was out of the ward. If his ancestor died
before he had attained that age, his lord had by law the guardianship both
of his lands and person till then, and took the profits of the lands to himself
for his own use, being only obliged to educate and maintain the heir in a
condition suitable to his rank and station. The reason of this was, that it
was a principle in the feudal law, as the profits and the military duties were
equivalents for each other, that he who was obliged to the duty should enjoy
the profits, which, in the first instance, was the lord, he being obliged
to answer the king, or other superior lord, for all the military duties comprised
in his seignory.</p>

<p>He had the guardianship, likewise, of the heir’s person; first, that, because
of the bond under which he lay to the tenant and his heirs, the law
had entire confidence in the care he would take of the minor; secondly, because
the lord was certainly well qualified to instruct him in the art of war;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
and thirdly, his own interest obliged him to do this carefully, that his vassal
might be enabled to perform to him the future services. But this, as to
the person, is to be understood, if the minor’s father was not living. For
if he was, he was guardian by nature, and intitled to the custody of the
person, as in the case put by Littleton, where there is a grandfather by the
mother’s side, tenant, by knight service, father, and mother, and son; and
the mother dies, leaving the grandfather, and then the grandfather dies,
and his land descends to the son of his daughter, then a minor, the minor’s
father still alive; here the guardianship shall be divided. The grandfather’s
lord shall have the ward of the lands, and the father shall have the ward of
the person of his minor son. So it is if a lord gives land in fee by military
service to the son of A, by which son’s dying without issue the lands descend
to his brother, a minor. Here A, the father, shall have the custody
of the body, and the lord, of the lands. There was another case, likewise,
wherein the guardianship, I cannot say was divided, but where the wardship
of the person was extinct. Antiently, although twenty-one years was
the regular time, yet, if the minor was knighted by the king, and thereby
adjudged capable of service in person, the guardianship ceased. For here,
the legal presumption of unfitness was refused by a positive act of the king
to the contrary. But the lords obtained an act of parliament, that, notwithstanding
such knighthood in minority by the king, the lords should retain
the lands of the minor so knighted, till he was twenty-one years of age;
and so, after this act, the wardship of the lands continued, though that of
the person, who was by the king’s act declared <i>sui juris</i>, was gone<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.</p>

<p>The term of twenty-one years, which I have mentioned was confined, as
may appear by what I said concerning it, to heirs minor, that were males;
but with respect to heirs female, minors, as almost all of our fiefs soon after
the conquest were feminine feuds, as the lawyers on the continent call them,
that is, descendable to females in the next degree, if males in that degree
failed, the limitation of minority was different. In these fiefs it was impossible
the woman herself should do personal service: She was, therefore, allowed
a substitute; but in time of minority, as she could not appoint a proper
one, the lord who was bound to perform the service to his superior, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
the lands in the same manner as in case of an heir male. However, there
was no reason that the minority of a woman in wardship should continue so
long as that of a man, namely, to twenty-one years; for as the law of God
declared that man and wife should be one flesh; so the canon law, and ours
in consequence, have decreed, that, in law, the man and wife are one person,
and that the husband in all respects is bound to perform the obligations
she lies under. Hence, in case of a female heir, the term of the lord’s guardianship
was, by the common law, limited to fourteen years; by which
time it was presumed she might have a husband capable, and obliged to do
the duty for her. But this age of fourteen years was, in a particular case,
extended, by act of parliament, to two years farther. However, as the
reason of that depends on the lord’s right to the marriage of the heiress, it
will be better to defer speaking thereof, until we come to that head.</p>

<p>It remains to be mentioned, what was the nature of this interest the
lord had in the estate of this minor tenant, by virtue of the feudal institutions,
and so contrary to the general and the original tenure of them. For, simply,
the lord had only the propriety, and in consequence the right of reversion
or escheat, with the render of the services; whilst the tenant had the
possession and the profits. But, in this case, all these seem to be blended,
particularly the right of original propriety and possession, so essentially to be
distinguished in the feudal system. For the lord has not only his propriety
in right of his seignory, but also the absolute possession, and permanency, or
taking of the profits, and the minor heir apparently nothing. However,
the law, in this case, did justice, and created in the lord a temporary interest,
an estate for years, namely, for the number of years till the majority was
compleated, contrary to all the other feudal maxims. For the fee and inheritance
of the estate remained in the minor, though he had neither possession
or profits. This interest of the lord could not be called, at least with strict
propriety, a tenancy for years, because, in this case, the lord possesses the
tenant’s lands, not the tenant. The lords had therefore no tenure, but an
estate for years, created by the law; and that it was originally considered
as an estate for years, or a chattle interest in lands, appears from two
things. First, that in the early times, when alienations were scarce allowed,
it was assignable over to another, without any licence or form. Secondly,
that instead of going to the heir, in case of the lord’s death, during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
minority of the ward, it went to the lord’s executors, as other estates for
years did<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.</p>

<p>As the lord was bound to his vassal and his heirs by the homage done to
him, it certainly followed, that it was not lawful for him to do, during the
wardship, any actual waste (that is, any permanent damage) to the estate
of his minor ward, or to suffer any to be done by others. He was also
obliged to repair and keep in condition, out of the profits of the estate, the
houses and improvements thereon; yet so great was the misbehaviour of
the English lords, soon after the conquest, that many severe and restrictive
laws were, from time to time, made in favour of the minor wards<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.</p>

<p>In my next I shall treat of guardians in socage, reserving the article of
marriage, though it appertained to military service, to a place by itself; as
it was of a distinct nature, and went on its own particular ground in a great
measure.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wardship in Socage—The nature and history of the incident of marriage.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having, in the last lecture, given some account of wardship and
guardianship in chivalry, it will be necessary to mention what provision
the law made, now lands were become hereditary, for the benefit of a
minor, when lands, held in socage, descended to him. In the former case,
where war was the consideration, whose times and exigences were uncertain,
the law was obliged, on account of the public safety, to consider the interest
of the lord, who was to answer the duties to the state, in the first place, and
the interest of the minor only in a secondary light. But in socage lands,
which the lord had parted with for certain fixed stipulated services, to be
paid at particular times, the lord had no claim to any more than them. Neither
did the public interest demand a military person for the guardian of one
who was not to be bred a soldier. A near relation, therefore, was the properest
person to take the wardship.</p>

<p>But in fixing who that person should be, the feudal and the Roman civil
law proceeded on different principles; the latter fixed upon the nearest relation
that was inheritable to the estate, but the former entirely excluded
all relations that might inherit. Thus, if the land descended on the side of
the father, all relations of the father were incapable, and the mother, or
the next of kin of her blood, was the guardian. And this is a difference
wherein the English lawyers greatly triumph over the civilians. For to give
the care of a minor to one who might be his heir, is, they say, <i>quasi agnum
lupo committere ad devorandum</i>. But this very reason strongly proves the general
wickedness and barbarity of the people, who were obliged to establish
this rule at that time. Both laws were equally wise, because adapted each
to the circumstances of the nations that made them. The Romans, who
were a polished civilized people, among whom murders were infrequent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
were not afraid to trust the person of the minor to the care of one who might
be his heir; and such an one they preferred on account of the preservation
of the estate, which they presumed would be taken best care of by him to
whom it might descend. The northern nations, on the contrary, who were
barbarians, and murderers, were obliged to sacrifice the consideration of
preserving the estate, to the personal safety of the infant, and therefore committed
both to one who could have no interest in the succession.</p>

<p>The guardian in socage differed from guardian in chivalry in this, that
he was but in the nature of a bailiff, or trustee, for the minor, to whom,
at the expiration of his guardianship, he was obliged to account, upon an
allowance of all his reasonable costs and charges. Another difference was,
as to the <i>term</i> of the guardianship. For this guardianship expired at the
ward’s full age of fourteen; at which time, if he pleased, he might enter
and occupy the lands himself, or choose another guardian; for as at that
age he had discretion enough to consent to marriage, so did the law suppose
he had sufficient perhaps to manage his own affairs, at least to choose the
properest person for that purpose<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.</p>

<p>But put the case, Suppose that the minor doth not enter, or choose another
guardian, but that the old one continues to receive the profits, what
remedy shall the minor have for those received after his age of fourteen?
Certain it is, he cannot bring an action of account against him as guardian;
for guardianship is expired; and yet the infant’s discretion cannot be presumed
so great, as to be perfectly acquainted with all his legal rights, and
therefore his negligence shall not be imputed to him. The law in this case
remedieth him by a reasonable fiction, and supposeth, though the fact hath
not been so, that the minor had appointed him to receive the profits of the
estate, and therefore gives an action of accounts against him, not as guardian,
but as bailiff or receiver.</p>

<p>But suppose the next of kin neglects the guardianship, and any other
person of his own head enters, and takes the profits, what remedy shall the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
minor have? In this case the law will not suppose him that enters to be a
wrong doer, an <i>abator</i>, as the law would call him, if the heir was of full
age; but will rather presume his act proceeded from humanity and kindness,
to supply the neglect of the proper guardian; and therefore, though
he is not appointed guardian, either by the act of law or otherwise, he
shall be considered as such, and the heir, after fourteen, shall have an action
of account against him, and charge him as guardian. So strictly was the
guardian in socage accountable to his ward for the profits, that, if he
married him within the age of fourteen, he was not only accountable for
the money he received in consideration thereof (as it was the practice in
those days to sell the marriage of wards) but if he received none, he was
accountable out of his own fortune for what he might have received on that
account, unless the match itself was equally, or more beneficial.</p>

<p>The next consequence of fiefs becoming hereditary, and which followed
from the wardship, is the <i>marriage</i> of the ward by military service, which belonged
to his lord, and was one of his beneficial fruits of tenure; and although
this part of our law is now antiquated by the abolishing of knight-service,
it is necessary, for the understanding our books, to have at least a
general notion of it.</p>

<p>This right rose originally, on the continent, from fiefs becoming descendible
to female heirs, and was grounded upon the same principle as the
rule which forbad vassals to alien without their lords consent. As every
feudal kingdom, at this time, consisted of a number of principalities, under
their respective lords, who were often at war with each other, the tenant
could not alien without his lord, lest he might introduce an enemy into the
feudal society. The like danger was there if a female heiress was permitted
to marry at her own pleasure, or could be disposed of by her relations without
the lord’s consent. And at first, it seems, that this rule was general to
a woman heiress during her whole life; but if so it was, it soon abated, and
was confined to the marriage of females in wardship, and to the first marriage
only. The law of Normandy says, if a woman be in wardship, when
she shall be of an age to marry, she ought to marry by the counsel and licence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of her lord, and by the counsel and assent of her relations and friends, according
to what the nobleness of her lineage and the value of her fief shall
require. So that antiently the lord had not the absolute disposal of her,
nor had he any thing to say to the marriage of males; for though he should
marry an enemy, the fief was not thereby put into subjection to her, but she
into the subjection of the vassal. And this rule, that the lord’s consent
should be had, was not intended for him to make an advantage of, but was
a mere political institution, for the safety of the community. Such was the
law introduced into England at the conquest. However, it was but natural
to expect that avaricious lords would take advantage of their negative voice,
to extort money for licence, and by that, and their influence over their vassals,
to arrogate the sole power to themselves. That William Ruffus acted
thus, we may well learn from the remedial laws of his brother and successor
Henry the First; <i>Si quis baronum, vel hominum meorum, filiam suam nuptum
tradere voluerit, sive sororem, sive neptem, sive cognatam, mecum inde loquatur;
sed neque ego aliquid de suo pro hac licentia accipiam, neque ei defendam quin eam
det, excepto si eam jungere velit inimico meo</i>. Another is, <i>Si mortuo barone, vel
alio homine meo, filio hæres remanserit, illam dabo consilio baronum meorum</i><a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these laws, the mischief still gained ground, and the
lords extended their encroachments, until they not only got the absolute
disposal of female, but of male heirs also. When this happened, is hard to
determine precisely. That it was after Glanville, who wrote in Henry the
Second’s time, and before Bracton, who wrote in Henry the Third’s, is
plain: Mr Wright’s conjecture seems probable, that it grew up in Henry
the Third’s time, when the barons were very powerful, from a strained
construction of Magna Charta, which says, <i>Hæredes maritentur absque disparagatione</i>;
where the general word <i>hæredes</i> should have been construed to
extend only to such heirs as by the former law were marriageable by their
lords, namely, female ones; but both king and lords, taking advantage of
the generality of the expression, claimed and usurped that of the son’s
also<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>However, it is rather to be presumed that this incroachment began earlier;
since in the statute of Merton, the twentieth of Henry the Third, we
find these words: <i>Quia maritagium ejus qui infra ætatem est</i> (speaking of a
male) <i>mero jure pertinet ad dominum feudi</i>. From whence I rather gather
the practice was earlier than Magna Charta, which was not above thirty
years before, and confirmed by its interpretation. But if, in this respect,
the vassals were encroached on by their lords, in another, they met with a
mitigation in their favour. For the consent during the father’s life, went
into disuse, and every man was allowed to marry his son or daughter at his
pleasure; and this with very good reason. For as the prohibition was
for fear of introducing an enemy, of this there was no danger where the
marriage was by the father, a vassal, bound by homage and fealty to do
nothing to the prejudice of his lord. Thus was right of consent to marriage,
introduced first for political reasons, turned into a beneficial perquisite,
and fruit of tenure, for the advantage of the lord; and notwithstanding
all the laws made to regulate it, as constantly abused; so that the evils
thence arising were not among the least causes for abolishing military
tenures<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.</p>

<p>The penalty for marrying without consent was originally, as all breaches
of fealty were, absolute forfeiture. But the rigour of the feudal law subsiding,
lighter penalties were introduced. By the sixth chapter of Merton
remedy is given to the lord, whose ward, under fourteen, has been taken
away by any layman (and a later act extends it to the clergy) and married,
by an action against the <i>raptor</i> or <i>ravisher</i>, as he is called, for the value of
the marriage, besides imprisonment and a fine to the king. If the ward
himself, after the age of consent, or fourteen, should, to defraud his lord,
marry himself, he, as guilty of a breach of fealty, is more grievously punished
than a stranger. For this act provides, that the lord, in that case, shall
retain the lands after the full age of twenty-one, for so long a time as, out
of the profits, he might receive double the value of the marriage<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

<p>The next, the seventh chapter, is in favour of the ward, and an inforcement
of that chapter of Magna Charta which forbids disparagements without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
inflicting any penalty. It enacts, that if the minor under fourteen is
married by his Lord to his disparagement, upon the plaint of his relations,
the lord shall lose the wardship; and the profits of the lands, till full age,
shall be received by the relations so complaining, and laid out for the benefit
of the heir. But if the marriage was after fourteen, the age of consent,
it was no forfeiture, on the maxim, <i>Volenti non fit injuria</i>. This act goes
farther in favour of the minor; for it gives him a liberty of refusing any
match the lord should offer him. But to prevent the lord’s entirely losing
the benefit of the marriage by the refractoriness of the ward, it enacts, in
this case, that if he refuses a convenable marriage, the lord shall hold the
lands after twenty-one to his own use, until such time as his late ward shall
pay him the single value thereof.</p>

<p>The twenty-second chapter of Westminster the first confirms and repeats
the sixth of Merton, and farther obviates a fraudulent practice of the guardians
of female heirs. I observed that their wardship by law ceased at the
age of fourteen, by which time they might have husbands capable of the
service: but some lords, <i>for covetousness of the lands</i>, as the act expresses it,
would not offer any match at all to their female wards, under the pretence
of their being incapable of the services, in order to hold on the lands for an
unlimited time. This act so far alters the old law, that if the heiress arrives
unmarried at the age of fourteen, the lord should hold two years longer,
that he may have time to look out for a proper match to tender her, within
which time, if he neglects it, he loses all right to her marriage. On the
other hand, if the heiress will refuse a suitable offer, the lord is impowered
to retain the lands until twenty-one, and so much longer, until he has received
out of the profits satisfaction for the value.</p>

<p>The ravishment of wards from their lords continuing, notwithstanding
the statute of Merton, the thirty-fifth of Westminster the second gave the
writ called <i>Of ravishment of ward</i>, and assigned a more speedy and beneficial
method of proceeding, and added to the punishments by the former act of
Merton inflicted on offenders<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>But notwithstanding all these regulations concerning marriages, and the
other many acts made to prevent misbehaviour of lords to the lands of their
wards, the source of the evil remained in the wardship itself; and the evils
constantly followed, insomuch that for hundreds of years, it was one of the
heaviest grievances the subject suffered. Many were the wastes done to
estates; many the heirs married contrary to their inclinations, and frequently
unsuitably. The grievances fell heaviest on the wards of the crown.
There were always a set of needy or greedy courtiers ready, if they had favour
enough to beg, or otherwise to buy at an under rate, the wardships
of minor tenants, of which they were sure to make the most advantage;
marrying the most opulent heirs to their own children, or relations, or extorting
extravagant sums for their consent. A remarkable instance of this
happened so lately as Charles the First’s time, in the case of the earl, afterwards
first duke of Ormond. A long suit had subsisted between the lady
Preston, grand-daughter and heiress at law of Thomas earl of Ormond, and
her cousin, the heir male of the family, for that part of the estate her grandfather
had entailed to go with the title. At length the relations on both
sides thought the best expedient to end this intricate dispute, was by uniting
the young relations, who likewise had conceived a strong affection for
each other; yet, although the king approved highly thereof, did the earl of
Warwick, who was grantee of the young lady’s wardship, extort ten thousand
pounds before he would consent to a marriage on every account so desirable.</p>

<p>King Henry the Eighth, finding how grievously the subject was oppressed,
and how much the crown was defrauded, erected, by act of parliament,
a court called the <i>Court of Wards</i>, to take proper care of minors, and to answer
in a moderate manner for the profits to the king. This for some time
was a considerable alleviation of the load; but in the weak reign of James
the First, who was governed by his favourites Somerset and Buckingham,
this court was converted into an engine for raising their families, by providing
their numerous and indigent relations with the greatest heiresses, to
the great discontent of the antient nobility, who saw the most opulent fortunes
suddenly raised by private gentlemen, dignified by titles for the purpose.
And great were the extortions likewise for the licenses that were
granted to some to marry at their pleasure. The only advantage the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
reaped at this time from this right of disposal in marriage was, and it must
be allowed to be a considerable one, the opportunity it gave the crown of
breeding the heirs of many families in the reformed religion; and in justice,
it must be owned, this was not neglected.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth year of this last reign, it was moved in parliament to
purchase off these heavy burthens of ward and marriage, by settling an
handsome yearly revenue in lieu thereof on the crown. But the attempt
did not succeed at that time, probably owing to the courtiers opposition to
it, from their own interested views. In Charles the First’s reign, this court
was one of the great objects of complaint. At length, on the restoration,
the king consented to turn all the military tenures, except grand serjeanty,
into socage, in consideration of an hereditary revenue settled on him, and
so all the fruits thereof ceased, and the feudal system, which had for ages,
from time to time, undermined the constitution, fell to the ground, though
very many of the rules of our law, founded on its principles, still retain
their force<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. In this kingdom the equivalent given for this abolition was
the tax of hearth-money, in which, it must be owned, the king, and those
who had been his military tenants, were a little too sharp for the rest of the
people; for by the improvements of the kingdom, that revenue is every day
increasing to the crown, and almost the whole burthen is thrown on the
lower class, who before felt none of the oppression, or weight of wardship
and marriage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LECTURE_XIV">LECTURE XIV.</h2>

<p><i>The rules of descent in the old feudal law in regard to the sons of the last possessor—Representation
and collateral succession—Feminine feuds.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It is now time to see how inheritances descended by the feudal law, where,
in the original grant, there were no particular directions to guide the
descent; for in such case the maxim of the feudal law holds, <i>Tenor investituræ
est inspiciendus</i>; or, as the common law expresses it, <i>Conventio vincit
legem</i>. The first rule then was, that descendants of the first acquirer, and
none others, were admitted. The reason was, that his personal ability to do
the duties of the fief was the motive of the grant, together with the obligation
his fealty laid him under to educate his offspring to the lord’s obedience,
and to qualify him for his service in war. It was observed, therefore,
it should go to the first purchaser’s collateral relations, whom he had no
power to bind by his acts, and over whose education he had no influence.
I mean where it was not particularly otherwise expressed; for then the collaterals
succeeded, as the merit of their blood was part of the consideration;
not so properly in the right of heirs, as by way of remainder, under the
lord’s original grant<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.</p>

<p>The next thing to be enquired is, since the descendants alone inherited,
whether all, or which only of them inherited. And here the females and
their descendants, unless they were specially named, were totally excluded,
not merely for their personal incapacity, but lest they should carry the fief
to strangers, or enemies; and therefore, where they were admitted, they
were obliged to marry with the consent of the lord. The third rule is, that,
unless it was otherwise stipulated, all the sons succeeded equally to the father.
This was the antient feudal law, and the law of England in the Saxon
times, the relicks of which remain in the gavel kind of Kent, and remained
in the last century in many, if they do not still in some of the principalities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
of the empire. In France, during the first, and a good part of the second
race, we see the kingdom divided among the sons. There are not wanting
instances of the same among the English Saxons; and the Spaniards continued
the practice now and then even in later ages. But the frequent
wars, occasioned by these partitions, at length abolished them, and made
kingdoms to be considered as indivisible inheritances. In imitation of the
sovereignty, the same alteration was introduced into the great seignories,
which made, at this time the principal strength of the kingdom, and
which, now the crown was become indivisible, would, if liable to partition,
become so inconsiderable in power, as to be at the mercy of the king<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.</p>

<p>The inconveniencies attending the lower military tenancies which still
continuing divisible, were crumbled into very small portions, and, of course,
must have fallen into indigent hands, were such, that these also, for the most
part, became descendible to a sole heir. But this, however, was not effected
but by degrees; for in the reign of Henry the First, though a single knight’s
fee was not divisible, yet when a man died seized of more than one, they
were distributed among his sons as far as they went; but in his grandson’s
reign the general law was settled in favour of a single heir, in the same manner
as it has stood ever since<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>.</p>

<p>But it remains to be enquired which of the sons, in case of an indivisible
inheritance, should be this sole heir. In the antient and unsettled times,
the law made no particular provision; but, as the lord was the head of the
military society, and bound to protect it, it was left to his option to fix upon
the properest person to do the duties: and an instance of the exertion of
this power we have in England so late as the reign of Henry the Second,
who gave the entire military lands of Geoffry de Mandeville to his son by
a second ventre, to the exclusion of the eldest by a former wife, for this
reason, <i>eo quod melior esset miles</i>. A trace of this still remains in the case of
a peerage, descendible to heirs general, that is, male or female, falling to
daughters. Here the fief being indivisible, the king may appoint the peerage
to which he pleases, and until he doth so, it is not indeed extinguished,
but lieth dormant, being what is called <i>in abeyance</i>, or the custody of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
law. But at length this uncertainty was removed, and the eldest son being
generally the best qualified, and consequently almost always chosen, obtained
the right, by degrees, in exclusion of his brethren, or the choice of the
lord<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

<p>But it will be inquired with respect to kingdoms, who had no superior to
make the choice, how was it to be determined after they became indivisible,
which of the sons was to succeed, seeing the absolute right of primogeniture
was not yet established in the opinions of men. I answer, the usual practice
was for the king himself, before his death, to appoint the successor; generally
with the consent and approbation of his states, and sometimes merely
by his own act, which was almost universally allowed, and obeyed by the
people. But if no such disposition had been made, the states assembled,
and chose the person themselves; and these appointments generally falling
on the eldest son, paved the way for lineal hereditary succession, though the
case was not always so.</p>

<p>In France, Hugh Capet, to go no higher, in order to prevent competition,
caused his son Robert to be crowned, and sworn allegiance to in his
lifetime; but Robert neglecting the same precaution, Henry his younger
son was chosen in preference of the elder, who was obliged to content himself
with the dutchy of Burgundy. And if Henry was an usurper, so were
all the succeeding kings of France for three hundred years, till that family
of Burgundy failed. Henry followed his grandfather Capet’s example, and
so did his successors for about an hundred years, and then, the notion of
the lineal succession of the eldest son being fully established, the custom of
crowning the son in the father’s life, was laid aside, as unnecessary.</p>

<p>In England the practice was antiently the same. William the Conqueror,
though he set up a claim under Edward the Confessor’s will, yet as
that never appeared, a formal election by which he was chosen, extorted indeed
by dread of his power, but apparently free, was his title. When pressed
to declare a successor, he only signified his wish that William might succeed,
but declared he would leave the people of England as free as he had
found them. William accordingly was elected in prejudice of his elder
brother Robert, and upon his death, occasioned by an accident, Robert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
was again excluded, and Henry the First, the third brother, chosen. Henry
was willing to have the course of descent secured in his offspring; and
for this purpose proceeded in the method that had been so successful in
France, namely, by causing his son Henry to be crowned, and sworn to.
But this latter dying childless in the lifetime of his father, king Henry
caused his daughter Maud to be acknowledged successor, and the oath of
eventual allegiance to her to be taken by his people. However, this project
did not succeed. No nation of Europe had yet seen a crown on the head
of a female; and Spain was the only country that had ever had a king who
claimed in a female right. The majority, therefore, upon Henry’s death,
looked upon their oath as inconsistent with the nature of monarchy, and void,
and in consequence chose Stephen, who was the son of Maud’s aunt, and
grandson of the Conqueror, whose whole male issue was now spent. There
was, however, a large party in the kingdom who paid a greater veneration
to the obligation of their oath, and adhered to Maud. Hence was this
reign a continued scene of civil war, until all sides, being wearied out, by
mutual consent, ratified by the states of the kingdom, Stephen was allowed
king for life, and Maud’s personal pretensions, as a woman, being set aside,
her son, Henry the Second, was declared, and sworn to, as eventual successor<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.</p>

<p>Henry the Second followed the example of his grandfather, and had
his eldest son Henry crowned; but that ungrateful prince conspiring and
rebelling against him at his death, which likewise happened in the lifetime
of his father, the old king fearing the like consequences, refused to crown
his next son Richard; who conscious of his own ungrateful conduct, and
suspecting that this refusal proceeded from partiality to John, the youngest
and favourite son, stirred up those commotions and rebellions which broke
his father’s heart. Richard was the next heir, and did succeed, but not
merely in the right of next heir; for he assumed no title but that of duke
of Normandy, until he was elected and crowned. The title of John was
notoriously by election, and his son Henry the Third was the first who was
introduced to his subjects by the words, <i>Behold your king</i>, or words equivalent.
Those few who adhered to his father, immediately swore to him;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
but the majority, who were disaffected, did not submit but upon terms, the
restoration of the charters.</p>

<p>From that day the lineal succession has been established, and the crown
is vested in the successor upon the death of his ancestor, and the maxim
prevailed of the king’s never dying; whereas before, the crown was in
abeyance, till coronation, and the date of the king’s reign was taken,
not as now, from the death of the former monarch, but from the day
that the succeeding one was crowned. Henceforth coronation became a
mere ceremony, though the form of an election is still continued in it. I
have been more particular in this detail, in tracing the origin of the hereditary
descent of the crown, to shew how false in fact, as well as in reason,
the notion is of its being founded either on divine right, or on any law of
man coeval with the monarchy<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.</p>

<p>Having laid down the rules of descent in the old feudal law, in regard
to the sons of the last possessor, it will be proper next to mention how far it
admitted representation, or collateral succession; for at first both were excluded.
If a man had two sons, one of which died before him, leaving a
son, the grandson could not succeed to his grandfather, but the uncle was
sole heir. This was grounded partly on the presumption that the uncle was
of more mature age, and better qualified to do the service; but this could
not be the only reason, for the rule was general, and held where the grandson
was of full age and capacity. We must have recourse, therefore, to a
farther cause, which was also the same that, in those old times, prevented
collateral descents; for if a man had two sons, by the old law, the estate
was divided between them. If one of these died without issue, the brother
did not succeed to the share of the deceased, but it reverted, as an escheat,
to the lord. The reason of both these was, that he that claims by descent,
must claim through the last possessor, and derive his right from him; and
that right arose from the supposition of his being educated in the fealty of
the lord, that is, by the last possessor who had sworn fealty. Therefore the
grandson, being educated under the <i>patria potestas</i> of his father, who, dying
before the grandfather, had never taken the oath of fealty, was excluded
the succession, as not trained up by a real tenant; but the uncle was admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
to claim from the grandfather, the tenant under whom he was
bred<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.</p>

<p>This rule was of some advantage to the feudal system at that time, as it
frequently prevented the too great crumbling of fiefs, when almost all of
them were divisible. For the same reason a brother could not succeed to a
brother, even in a paternal fief, because he was not educated by the last
possessor that had done fealty: and though this seems very unreasonable, as
he had been bred in the fealty of the lord, namely by the father, yet this
rule continued for ages, being greatly for the advantage of the king and
the great lords, in regard to their escheats; as every failure of a lineal descent
occasioned them to happen. Neither was it thought severe in those
early ages by the tenants. As all benefices were originally for life, it was a
great advantage to have them made descendible even under these strict
limitations<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p>

<p>At length the necessity of Charlemagne’s grandsons, who had parted the
empire, and were in eternal broils, extorted from them, in France, a grant
of the grandson’s succeeding in his father’s share, by way of representation,
in imitation of the civil law, and also of brothers succeeding to brothers in a
paternal fief, but not in a new one. And about an hundred and fifty years
the like necessity of the emperor Conrad, who was embroiled with the Pope,
procured the same law for Germany and Italy<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</p>

<p>The extension of the right of collateral succession beyond brothers grew
up by degrees, not from any positive law. It was first extended to uncles
and cousin-germans, provided it was a fief descended from the grandfather;
afterwards to any the next cousin, to the seventh degree, descended
from the first purchaser; and at last to any, however remote, who could
prove their descent from the first purchaser. This was the rule in ancient
inheritances; but with respect to new ones, lately acquired, there grew up
a practice of granting them <i>as ancient</i> ones; <i>feudum novum, ut antiquum, datum</i>.
Here the fief, though really new, was, by means of this grant, supposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
to proceed from some indefinitely remote ancestor, at any distance;
and therefore any one, who could prove himself descended from a common
ancestor of the last possessor, was admissible, and he that was nearest by the
rules of succession was preferred. In this case, therefore, the old rule of requiring
a proof, that the person claiming as heir was a descendant of the
body of any ancestor of the last possessor, would be absurd, as defeating the
tenure of investiture. Any ancestor <i>pro re nata</i> might be supposed the first
purchaser, to support the intention of the donor, in his directing it to be
considered as an ancient fief, although in fact modern. So in this case, if
the fief was masculine, any male relation, descended from male blood entirely,
was inheritable, even up to Adam, I mean, if he could prove his descent;
but females, and their descendants were excluded<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.</p>

<p>If it was descendible to females, either by the particular terms of the
grant, or by the general law of the country, then, as it was supposed to descend
from any lineal ancestor <i>pro re nata</i>, that ancestor might be a female,
and the descendants of females, and they themselves might be admissible.
The rule then was, to establish in this case of a fictitious descent, the same
regulations as in the case of a real one. But here the root from whence the
right of descent was to spring, was inverted; for as there was no real ancestor,
an original purchaser, the person last seized, that is possessed of the fee,
was the person to be considered. As in the old and common case of inheritances
descending, the reckoning was downwards from the first acquirer;
in case of collaterals, when they were admitted, you begin to reckon lineally
upwards, and at every step enquire for collaterals descended from that
lineal ancestor you are upon at the time<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<p>A man purchases <i>feudum novum, ut antiquum</i>, and dies without heirs of
his body. This feud is, by the constitution of it, presumed to have descended
from some of his ancestors. To find out who is that ancestor, it
was likely to have descended from, you must look at the law of descents:
the father, in the first place, is supposed the person. His children, that is,
the brothers or sisters, or their descendants, in the first place; if none of
them, the grandfather by the father is supposed the person; then the
grandfather’s descendants. The uncles and aunts by the father, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
descendants, succeed in the second place. If none of them, then the great
grandfather’s by the grandfather and father descendants, the great uncles
and aunts, and their posterity; and if there are none of them, you still go a
step higher in the male line, till you can trace it no farther. But now you
begin to invert the rule of tracing up in the male ancestors, and so downwards,
and trace up to the female ancestor of the males, as supposing the
estate descended from her, or her ancestors. For instance, I have supposed
the descendants of the male line have failed in the great grandfather. His
wife, therefore, the great grandmother, is supposed the first purchaser;
for, upon account of the probability of the inheritance coming through
males, I trace up to her through the father and grandfather; her heirs,
therefore, shall succeed, first, lineal, then collateral, in the same manner
as if the estate had descended from a remote ancestor of her’s. If none such
can be found, we descend another step, namely, to the grandmother by the
father, and suppose the estate to have come from her line; and then heirs,
first lineal, then collateral, succeed according to their several ranks. If
none of these, so that there is no kindred on the side of the father, the presumption
is, that this supposed antient feud came from the mother’s family,
and therefore the heirs of her male ancestors are to be traced up, and discovered
in the same manner; and whenever they fail, the heir of the most remote
female ancestor, all through males; and failing them, the heir of the
next most remote, and so on, until the blood of the mother is spent; and
then the estate, for want of heirs, reverts to the lord, of whom it is holden.</p>

<p>Such is the rule of descents of new purchases granted as if they had been
ancient inheritances; but this rule was, on the Continent, and anciently in
England, confined to such grants, and them only, wherein this clause appeared
in the investiture. But in the reign of Stephen, his necessity of gaining
adherents, and the same necessity of his competitor Henry the Second,
occasioned so many grants of this kind to be made, some originally, and
others on the surrender of old ones, that it hath since become the common
law of England, that purchases, that is, new acquisitions, are descendible to
any relation, however remote<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to say something as to <i>feminine feuds</i>, which are a deviation
from the strict principles of the ancient law, which excluded them and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
their descendants entirely. They first arose from the woman’s being the
principal consideration of the grant; as when a lord gave lands in marriage
with his daughter, sister, niece, kinswoman, or any other female: here
the lands being partly given in consideration of the female blood, it was reasonable
they and their descendants should be inheritable. But this was still
an exception to the general law, and confined to those grants wherein it was
mentioned, until the number of those grants, at length prevailed to have
this order of succession considered as the general law, and the succession of
males remote, in exclusion of a nearer female (as in case of tail male) considered
as an exception. The monarchy of France, however, and of many
of the principalities of Germany, have retained the antient feudal law, in
absolutely excluding females and their descendants.</p>

<p>The descent of imperial crowns to females, was of a much later date, than
that of lower fiefs: for here a manly capacity was looked upon as indispensibly
requisite. The first step was admitting a male representative for them, a
husband or a son. This began in Spain. Pelagius, who was of the blood
royal, having gathered a few of the Spanish fugitives together, after the
Moorish conquest, founded a pretty monarchy in the mountains of Asturias.
His son Favila dying without issue, the crown was given to his daughter’s
husband, and this continued the rule for many ages, where males failed.
But where the son of such female heir was of sufficient age to mount the
throne, he of course excluded both mother and father. At length, in the
thirteenth century, Europe, for the first time, saw a woman solely invested
with royalty, Joan the first of Naples; for Henry the first of England’s project
in favour of his daughter Maud, as we have said before, had miscarried.
Margaret of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Joan the second of Sicily,
and Isabella of Castile, followed in the next century. In the following century
came Mary and Elizabeth in England, and many since in all parts of
Europe; so that at present the monarchies of Europe are descendible to
females in general, if we except France, and several but not all of the principalities
of the empire. Bohemia and Hungary have received a queen in
the person of the present empress in this present century, but so inveterate
are old customs and opinions, that when her faithful Hungarians resolved
to assist her to the last extremity, it was by saying, <i>moriamur pro rege nostro
Maria Teresa</i>, not <i>pro regina</i><a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.</p>

<p><i>The difference between allodial and feudal lands—The restrictions on the feudal
law—The decay of these—The history of voluntary alienations.</i></p>

</div>

<p>One great and striking difference between allodial and feudal lands
consisted in this, that the former entered into commerce. They
were saleable or otherwise alienable, at the will of the possessor, either by
act executed, and taking effect in his lifetime, or by will, to take effect
after his death. They were likewise pledges to the king for the good behaviour
of the owner, and therefore for his crimes forfeitable against him
and his heirs. They were also security to his fellow subjects for the debts
he might contract; and, therefore, by following the due course of law, attachable
and saleable, to satisfy the demands of a just creditor<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.</p>

<p>In every one of these respects did fiefs, when they became descendible inheritances,
differ from them. The possessor was but an usufructuary, and his
power over his lands was checked and controlled by the interest others had
therein. These were the lord and the persons descended from the first purchaser.
The consent of the lord was absolutely necessary to the tenant’s alienation,
to prevent the introduction of an enemy or unqualified person into
the fief; but the consent of the lord alone was not sufficient, if there were
in being any persons entitled to the succession. Thus if A. is himself the
first purchaser of a fee, and hath a son, his alienation, even with the consent
of the lord, would hold good only during his own life; but if he had aliened
with the consent of the lord before issue had, this should be valid, and
bind the issue born afterwards. For here the alienation was made by all the
persons in being interested in the land, and the former contract is by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
mutual act dissolved, nor is there any wrong done; for it is an absurdity to
say that a person not <i>in rerum natura</i> can suffer wrong: the consent therefore
of the son, or sons, if one or more of them were in being, was as necessary
as the lord’s in this case.</p>

<p>If the lands descended from B. the first purchaser, to his son A. before
the introduction of collateral descent, the law was the same; but when
these were admitted, it varied for the same reason. A. could not alienate
with the consent of the lord and his sons, without the consent also of all
the collaterals intitled, that is, all the <i>agnati</i>, or male descendants of B. for
this would strip them of their right of succession. If it descended from C.
the grandfather, or from any more remote ancestor, the consent also of all
the male descendants of the grandfather, or that remote ancestor was required,
upon the same principle. By this we see, it was next to an impossibility,
that an estate which had been any time in a family (so many consents
were required) could be alienated at all. However, there was allowed
by that law a transfer of the fief in a particular case, even without
the consent of the lord. This was called <i>refuting the fief</i>; it was a resignation
of it to the person who was next in order of succession. Here was no
injury done to the lord, or the <i>agnati</i>, because it went in the same manner,
and to the same persons, as if the refuter was absolutely dead, <i>&amp; quisque
juri suo renunciare potest</i>. For the same reasons no testaments of lands were
allowed, except the lord, and all others concerned were present and consenting;
which scarce ever happening, it became a maxim of the English law,
that lands were not devisable by will.</p>

<p>Neither were the feudal lands originally forfeitable for the crimes of the
possessor for any longer time than his own life, if there were persons entitled
to the succession. But this rule of forfeiture was afterwards extended to
the issue of the criminal: for as the right of succession depended much on
the supposition the successor was educated in the fealty of the lord, this presumption
ceased where the father had actually broke his oath of fealty. And
at length, when the rule was established, that every person must claim
through him that was last seized, and make himself heir to him, the delinquency
of the predecessor became likewise a bar to collaterals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Feudal estates also were not liable to the debts contracted by the feudatory.
For if the creditor might have sold them for debt, a wide door for
alienation had been opened, by means of fictitious debts, contracted by collusion
between the creditor and vassal. Or even if they were honest ones,
the lords and the heirs would have been deprived of their right. Neither
could the creditor attach the profits of the land during the life of the debtor;
for if he could, an improvident vassal might so impoverish himself, as to be
incapable of the duties of the fief.</p>

<p>Such and so strong were the restrictions this old law laid on the feudatory.
But as times grew more settled, and the strictness of the military system
abated; as commerce increased, and with it luxury, the propensity to
alienation grew up, and became at length so strong, in every country, as
to be irresistable. And it is a speculation not only curious, but very useful
for the students of our law, to observe and remark its progress in England<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.</p>

<p>The first step towards voluntary alienations arose from the practice of sub-infeoffing.
Originally, as I observed in a former lecture, although the
vassals of the king could infeoff, their vassals could not; but at the latter
end of the second race in France, when the power of the crown was declined,
and the great lords were in reality sovereigns, acknowledging only
a nominal dependance on the king, some of them, in order to strengthen
themselves, and to increase the number of their military followers, allowed
this privilege not only to their immediate vassals, but to sub-vassals also, to
an unlimited degree. And when this practice was once begun, the other
lords, for their own security and grandeur, were obliged to follow the
example. This practice of subinfeuding contributed much to the power of
the lords, and therefore was by them encouraged. But though it was intended,
at first, only to extend to part of the vassal’s fief, the usage of subinfeuding
the whole gained ground, to the great prejudice of the heirs;
when the terms of subinfeudation were no better than those of the first
grant; and of the lords also, who thereby lost frequently their profitable
fruits of tenure, their reliefs, wardships, and marriages; which, with respect
to the lords, was remedied in the reign of Edward the First, by the statute
of <i>Quia emptores terrarum</i> before mentioned<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>In the mean time, free alienation was allowed in cities and boroughs;
partly because many of these were old Roman towns, and their lands and
houses allodial, and because those which were not so were founded by lords
on the same principles for the benefit of commerce, which could never have
flourished if a debtor had not full power over his property of all kinds to
satisfy his creditor; and if the creditor, in case he was unwilling, had not
power to compel him to sell for his just satisfaction. Alienations, however,
of one kind were permitted, namely, the founding of monasteries, and endowing
of churches. These, through the superstition of the times, were
looked upon as being equally beneficial to the feudal society as subinfeudation,
by engaging God in their interest; and even if the lords and their heirs,
who suffered by these grants, were willing to dispute them, they were unable
to contend with the omnipotent power of the pope and the clergy;
until at length the tyranny of the first, and the avarice of the last, provoked
both king and people to restrain them by the acts against Mortmain.
But no other alienations were yet allowed without consent, as before mentioned<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p>In the reign of William Rufus a particular matter occurred, which opened
a way for alienation without the lords consent, and occasioned a prodigious
revolution in the landed property of Europe. This was the madness
of engaging in crusades for the recovery of the Holy Land. A crazy friar
returning from a pilgrimage to Palestine, where he saw the Christians maltreated,
began to preach up this expedition as the most meritorious of
works; and it is wonderful with what an epidemical contagion the enthusiasm
spread through all ranks of people. These pilgrims, who assumed the
cross, had no way of defraying the expence, but by the sale of their lands,
which their lords, if disinclined, dared not to gainsay, or obstruct so pious a
work. But indeed, most of them were conscientiously affected with the
same madness, as may be seen by the great number of kings, princes, and
lords, that beggared themselves in these fruitless enterprizes<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>The pope and the kings concurred in inflaming this superstition, but
from different motives. The pope did it out of ambition and avarice.
The former he satisfied by declaring himself the head of the expedition, and
thereby attaching to himself and his see such multitudes of redoubted warriors
by the strongest of bonds, conscientious superstition. And indeed successors
in that chair afterwards made very good use of this example, by preaching
up crusades against such Christian kings and princes as disobliged them.
But the more immediate advantage he received, was the glutting his avarice
by a proper sale of dispensations to such as had rashly taken the cross, and
afterwards found themselves unable, or unwilling to fulfil the obligation.
The reason that induced the kings of Europe to promote this spirit, I mean
such of them as were not possessed with the frenzy themselves, was the hope
of abasing their too great and powerful vassals, which would naturally follow
from the alienation of part of their lands, to equip them for the expedition;
and a desire to facilitate the partition of these great seignories among females,
when the males were so frequently and miserably slaughtered<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.</p>

<p>So many were the alienations of this kind, and so long were they continued,
that it is no wonder that the interest of the lord and the heirs began
to lose ground in the opinions of the people, which proceeded so far, as that,
in the other cases, the lord, on the payment of a moderate fine, either before
or after, was looked upon as obliged to consent to the alienation.
Let us now see how the liberty of alienation gained ground, particularly in
England.</p>

<p>In Henry the First’s time, a man was allowed to alienate his purchase,
but not an estate that came by descent. This law says, <i>Acquisitiones suas det
cui magis velit; si Bocland autem habeat, quam ei parentes sui dederint, non
mittat eam extra cognationem suam</i><a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.</p>

<p>This liberty of alienation of purchases is not to be understood generally,
but only where the purchaser had no son; if he had any, it may be a doubt
whether he could alienate any part at this time. Certain it is, he could not
the whole, even in Henry the Second’s time. For thus Glanville lays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
down the law: <i>Si vero questum tantum habuerit, is qui partem terræ suæ donare
voluerit, tunc quidem hoc ei licet sed non totum questum, quia non potest filium
suum hæredem cohæredare</i><a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.</p>

<p>The practice of alienating lands by descent grew up more slowly. At
this time a part only was alienable, and that not freely, to all persons, or
for any consideration generally; but only in particular cases, first to the
church in Frankalmoigne; secondly, to one who had done services in war,
or to the fief in time of peace; thirdly, for the advancement of his family,
as in Frank-marriage with his daughter, sister, niece, or cousin. But every
day this liberty gained ground, until at length the interest of the heir entirely
vanished, and that of the lord began, in military tenures, to be little
considered, and not at all in socage. However, in Magna Charta some
check was given to that kind of alienation of the whole fief, that was carried
on under the pretence of subinfeudation. <i>Nullus liber homo det de
cætero amplius alicui vel vendat de terra sua quam ut de residuo terræ possit
sufficienter fieri domino feudi servitium ei debitum</i>; and this sufficiency was by
practice explained to the half of the fee<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.</p>

<p>No provision being made in these laws for the consent of the lords, they
generally, though not always, lost their fines; and a method likewise was
invented to obviate their refusal, by levying fines in the king’s courts of
record, in this manner. They used to suppose that the parties had covenanted
to alienate; and all writs of covenant (being actions of public concern
to the justice of the kingdom) were sueable only in the king’s court;
and by consequence this covenant to alienate was sueable only there. The
superior court then being possessed of the matter, as an <i>adversary cause</i>, permitted
the parties (on a fine being paid to the king, in lieu of that which
he would have received at the end of the suit, from the party that failed) to
make an amicable agreement or end of the suit, which was done by the
party sued coming in, and recognizing, that is, acknowledging in court
the right of the demandant to the land. This method of conveyance by
fine grew up, and still continues to be one of the common assurances of the
realm. For being transacted in a court of record, it obviated the danger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of future controversies between parties, or any dispute concerning the execution
of a deed, or the giving of livery and seizin<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.</p>

<p>At length the statute of <i>Quia emptores terrarum</i>, already mentioned, was
made, as well to remedy the mischiefs the lords complained they suffered
by subinfeudation, namely, the loss of their fruits of tenure, as to settle the
doubt, as to the right of the tenants to alienate. This statute entirely takes
away the lords consent; for it gives the tenant free power to sell, or alien
the whole, or part of his tenancy, to whom he pleased. But then, in favour
of the lord, it establishes, that if the tenant parts with his whole interest
in the lands, namely, the fee simple, the <i>alienée</i> should not hold of
the <i>alienor</i>, but immediately from the alienor’s lord, by the same services,
by which he, the alienor, had holden. Thus were the lords, in one respect
secured in their rights, by the stopping the course of subinfeudations,
and the tenants got a free liberty of alienation without the consent of the
lord, or paying any fine to him. The king, however, not being named
expressly in this act, it was construed not to bind him, as I have said before;
and his consent was still required to the alienation of his tenants by military
service, according to the rule of Magna Charta; that is, if more than half
was alienated, so that the residue was deemed unsufficient to answer the services.
And this was put out of doubt by the statute <i>De prerogativa regis</i>,
made the 17th of Edward the Second, cap. 6.</p>

<p>The bent towards free alienation, however, was so strong as to occasion
a further mitigation so soon after, as the first year of Edward the Third.
For then it was provided, that if the king’s military tenant alienated without
licence, contrary to the late act, the land so alienated should not be absolutely
forfeited as before, but that the king should be contented with a
reasonable fine in chancery. These compositions were sometimes dispensed
with, to encourage the tenants to attendance in hazardous expeditions; but,
except in those singular cases, they continued to be paid, until the reign of
Charles the Second, when knight’s service being abolished, they fell of
course along with it<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Such was the progress the alienation of land made by conveyance <i>inter
vivos</i>; but the bequeathing lands by last will did not keep equal pace with
it. The first step made thereto was by laying hold of the doctrine of <i>uses</i>,
which about the time of Richard the Second was invented by the clergy, to
elude the statutes of Mortmain, by which their advance from time to time
was checked. As in every feudal grant there were two estates, the absolute
propriety in the lord, a qualified property, namely, the possession and profits,
in the tenant; now that they were prohibited from taking the real
tenancy, they cunningly devised a means of subdividing the tenancy, by
separating the profits from the possession. When, therefore, a man
had a mind to alienate to the church, as he could not do it directly,
he infeoffed a person to the use of such a monastery. Here the feoffee
and his heirs were, in the construction of the common law, the proprietors,
but, in fact, were bare trustees for the monastery, for the use of
which they received the profits. But it may be asked, if the trustee or his
heirs would not suffer them so to do, where was their remedy. The courts
of common law allowed of no such division of estates at that time, nor would
they have suffered such necessary laws to be defeated by such collusion,
though they had been acquainted with these divided interests. They had
recourse, therefore, to chancery, where, it being always, to the time of
Henry the Eighth, filled with a churchman, they were sure to meet favour;
and this court claiming an equitable power to enforce persons conscientiously
to fulfil their engagements, compelled the trustee to support and
maintain the uses.</p>

<p>These uses, once introduced, were applied to other purposes, particularly
to that I am now upon, the enabling persons to dispose of their lands
by will. The manner was thus: A. aliens his lands to B. to the use of A.
himself for his life, and, after his death, to such uses as he A. should, by
his last will and testament, appoint. B. was then compellable in chancery,
not only to suffer A. to take the profits during life, but after his death to
execute the directions of the will, and to stand subject to the use of such
persons as he appointed, and make such estates as he directed. This method
gained ground every day, as many persons chose to retain their power
of alienation in their own hands, to the last moment of their lives, and to
keep their heirs, or other expectants, in continual dependance. And it at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
length grew so common, that in Henry the Eighth’s time, it was thought
proper to give leave, without going through this round-about method, to
dispose of lands directly and immediately by will; of the whole of their socage
lands, and of two thirds of the lands holden by knight’s service. And
this latter tenure being, after the Restoration, turned into common socage,
all lands, not particularly restrained by settlement, are since become devisable;
whereas, before these laws, they were only so in particular places,
by local custom. But the statute that gives this power, in order to prevent
frauds, expressly orders such will to be in writing; whence arose a distinction,
as to the validity of wills of land, according as these lands had, or had
not, been before devisable by custom. For those that were so before, continued
devisable by will <i>nuncupative</i>, or without writing<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.</p>

<p>But the reduction of the will into writing was not found sufficient to
prevent forgery and perjury, and therefore the statute of frauds and perjuries
has added other solemnities, as requisite to pass lands by will. It requires
that it shall be signed by the testator, or some other by his direction,
and attested by three witnesses in his presence.</p>

<p>As to signing, it is insignificant where the signature is, whether at the
bottom, or the top, or in the context of the will, the name of the testator,
written by his own hand, in any place, being sufficient. And the putting
his seal to the will, though without his writing, has been judged sufficient;
for his seal is as much his mark, or sign, as his handwriting. As to the
attestation, the statute requires it to be in the testator’s presence; but it is
absolutely necessary, that he should look on and see it done. Therefore, if
it is attested in the room where he lies sick in bed, with his curtains undrawn,
this is a good attestation; or if it is attested in a neighbouring room,
and the door open, so that he might possibly see it done, this is in his presence.
But if the door be shut, or the place so situated that he could not by
any means see the attestation, the will is void.</p>

<p>I shall next proceed to <i>involuntary alienation</i> of lands, namely, for payment
of debts; and then give an account of the origin and progress of
<i>estates tail</i>, which were introduced to restrain this power of alienation, and
to restore, in some degree, the old law of keeping estates in the blood of
the first purchaser.</p>

<p><i>Involuntary alienations of feudal land—Talliage—Edward I. introduces the
first involuntary attachment of lands—Statutes enacted for this purpose—Their
effects—The origin of estates Tail.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>involuntary</i> alienation of feudal land, namely, the attaching,
and afterwards the selling it for debt, kept pace pretty much, but
not strictly, with the voluntary alienation already treated of. It first began
in cities and trading boroughs, which were either the remains of old Roman
towns, and where, consequently, the estates were allodial; or else new
towns, founded either by the kings, or other great lords; or their demesnes,
for the benefit of trades and arts within their own districts. External
commerce, during those confused times, was little known or practised, the
Barbarians of the North infesting the coasts of the ocean, and the Saracens
and Moors, those of the Mediterranean. It was the interest, therefore, of
every lord who had such a town on his territory, to give it such privileges
as would make it flourish, and outrival the towns of like nature on the
lands of the king, or the neighbouring lords. For the natives of such
towns were no part of the feudal society, but were in the nature of socage
tenants in the early times, removeable, and consequently subject to be taxed,
or, as our law calls it, <i>talliagable</i>, from the French word <i>tailler</i> to cut<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>Talliage, consequently, was the cutting out a part from the whole of
the tenant’s substance, at the will of the lord. Yet this very power of talliage,
which the lords were not for a long time inclined to part with, joined
to their desire to make their towns flourish (that they might be able to bear
a greater talliage) put them under a necessity of making such provisions,
and granting such privileges, as were necessary for the use of trade and commerce,
and at length, in effect, destroyed that absolute power of taxation,
which the king and lords had all along claimed and exercised, and which at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
first, for their own interests sake (which no doubt they well understood) they
had used with great moderation. But after the discovery of the civil law at
Amalfi in Italy, in the reign of our Stephen, the kings of Europe, who
found therein an unlimited power of taxation in the emperor, were desirous
to establish the like authority in themselves; and for that purpose began
with oppressing their nobles with arbitrary scutages, or commutations for military
services; and the towns of their demesne with talliages, not only arbitrary,
but extravagantly beyond their power to pay without ruin<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.</p>

<p>John of England was particularly famous for these extraordinary charges;
for though his title to the crown was, at that time, by many of his subjects,
and by others abroad, much doubted (as in prejudice of his elder
brother’s son Arthur then a minor) and his only just claim could be but
by parliamentary authority, the omnipotence of which was not then so universally
admitted, never was there a prince who carried his prerogative to
such extravagant and oppressive heights. This, at length, occasioned the
making <i>Magna Charta</i>; partly to assert and restore the ancient liberties of the
nation, which had been invaded; partly to alter the old law, in such particulars
as had been the engines of oppression. One of the chief of these latter
remedies was the taking away the right of talliage, unless consented to in
parliament. And now were the boroughs emancipated, and the burgesses
made freemen, which before they could hardly be called, while their effects
lay wholly at the mercy of the lord<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.</p>

<p>In the next reign they advanced in importance; for as the treasure of the
kingdom was in their hands, they were sure to be favoured and courted on
both sides, during the fierce contests between the king and the barons. And
in the latter end of this reign it appears they had got admission into parliament,
which not a little increased their consequence. Edward the First was
a great favourer of merchants, and, for the security of their debts, introduced
the first involuntary attachment of lands by the act called <i>statute merchant</i>,
in the thirteenth year of his reign<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Before this time, no lands, except in boroughs by custom, were attachable
for debt, but only in the case of the king, who, by right of his prerogative,
could enter on the lands of his debtor, and receive the profits, until
he was paid. For the same political reason, the surety also for a debt to the
king, if he paid the debt, was allowed to come in the king’s place, and enjoy
the same privilege; but in all other cases, the chattles were the only mark
for the debt. This statute, after reciting that merchants had fallen into
poverty, for want of a speedy remedy for recovering their dues, provides,
that, in every city or great town, which the king should appoint, there
should be kept a <i>recognizance</i>, that is, the acknowledgement or confession of
debts due to merchants, and of the day of payment; and that, in case payment
was not made at the day, they may, or should, on the application of
the merchant, and inspection of the roll, imprison the body of the debtor until
payment; and if no payment was made within three months, (which
time the debtor was allowed to sell his chattles or lands) his chattles and lands
were to be delivered to the merchant creditor, at a reasonable valuation, or
<i>extent</i>, as it is called; that out of the profits he might satisfy himself. And
in case the debtor could not be found within the jurisdiction of the city or
town, or had no chattles or lands therein, then was the mayor to send into
chancery the recognizance of the debt, and the chancellor was to issue a writ
to the sheriff in whose bailiwick the debtor was or had effects, to act in like
manner. And so greatly was the merchant favoured, that tho’ this was but
an estate for years (it being certain, from the valuation, in what time the debt
would be paid), yet had he, with regard of maintaining actions to recover his
possession when deprived of it, the privileges of a free-holder given him, by
express provision in the act. Such was the favour shewn to merchants to
recover their just demands, nor were other creditors at this time left totally
unprovided for, in cases where there was a deficiency of chattles.</p>

<p>In the same year a law was made for attaching the lands of persons, in favour
of creditors who were not merchants, but in a different manner, called
an <i>elegit</i>. I shall here use the words of the statute, as they are sufficiently
plain, and easy to be understood. “When debt is recovered or acknowledged
in the king’s courts, or damages awarded, it shall be, from henceforth, in
the election of him that sueth for such debt or damages, to have a writ to
the sheriff of <i>fieri faciat</i> of the lands and goods” (which was the old remedy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
against the chattles) “or that the sheriff shall deliver to him all the
chattles of the debtor, saving only his oxen and beasts of his plough,
and the one half of his land, until the debt be levied upon a reasonable
price or extent.” After this the act gives the same privilege as in case
of statute merchant, to the creditor dispossessed. From his making his
election for the extending the lands, the writ directed to the sheriff for
that purpose got the name of <i>elegit</i>. The difference of execution just mentioned
shews clearly in how superior a light the legislature regarded the interests
of commerce. That the debts to merchants, in whose prosperity the
whole community was concerned, might be levied as soon as possible, the
security by statute merchant gave possession of the whole of the land to the
creditor; but the writ of <i>elegit</i> gave him possession of no more than one half.
Originally men could not alien lands at all. Afterwards they were allowed
to alien, but not beyond the half of the fief; and this principle or maxim
was strongly regarded at the time the writ of <i>elegit</i> was framed, which was
before the statute of <i>Quia emptores terrarum</i>, which allowed alienation of
the whole. So that whatever stretches might be found necessary, from the
circumstances of merchandize, yet, with regard to the kingdom in general,
a small deviation only was made from the common law, and the <i>elegit</i> was
allowed to affect no more by operation of law than a man was supposed
capable of alienating by his own deed<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.</p>

<p>Two reigns after, namely, the 27th of Edward the Third, when the mart,
or market of the standing commodities of England, namely, wool, woolfels,
hides, lead and tin, was removed from Flanders into England, and a court
merchant was erected in all such places where the staple was fixed, to be
held by the mayor of the staple, he had power given him to take recognizances
on the debts contracted at the staple, called <i>statute staple</i>, in the same
manner as of <i>statute merchant</i>; and as the effect thereof was the same as of
statute merchant, it need not be particularly repeated. However in some
time afterwards, statute merchant was, by custom, extended to others beside
merchants, and became one of the common assurances of the realm. The
statute staple was likewise extended upon surmise of the debt being contracted
at the staple; and though an act of Henry the Eighth in England restrained
this latter to its ancient bounds, yet, the same act framed a new kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
of security in imitation of it, common to all the subjects, called a recognizance
on that act, which had all the effects and advantages of it<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.</p>

<p>The statutes of Elizabeth and those since her time, concerning bankrupts,
have gone much further. They not only, in the cases they extend to, laid
the whole land open to the creditor, but, instead of a possession, and gradual
discharge of the debt, which was all that was given by the statute merchant,
<i>elegit</i>, or statute staple, they gave him a more speedy satisfaction, by enabling
him to procure a sale of the lands<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. But these later acts having never
been enacted in this kingdom, I shall content myself with having barely
hinted at them, and their effects.</p>

<p>Voluntary alienations of land having gained ground, and become at
length established in England, contrary to the principles of the original
law; and it being allowed for a maxim, that he that had a fee simple, had
an absolute dominion over half of his land, to dispose of as he pleased, and,
in some cases, of the whole; it could not be, but that there would arise
many persons fond of perpetuating their estates in their families, and consequently
displeased at this power of alienation. The means they used to
attain their ends was under that maxim of law, <i>Tenor investituræ est inspiciendus</i>,
or, as we express it, <i>Conventio vincit &amp; dat modum donationi</i>. Every man
therefore, absolute master of his estate, having a right to give it on what
terms he pleased, they began, not as before, to give lands to a man and his
heirs in general, for that would have given an absolute dominion, but to
heirs limited, as to the <i>heirs of his body</i>, or to the <i>heirs male</i> of his body, or
to the heirs of his body by such a woman. Here it was plain enough, that
none were intended to take, but such as came within this description; and
by this means they hoped to defeat the power of alienation, to secure the
estate to the persons described, and, in failure of them, the returning or
reversion of it to themselves or their heirs.</p>

<p>But the judges complying with the universal bent of the times to the
contrary, did not give these grants that construction they expected, upon
the natural presumption, that every person will have heirs of his body, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
that his posterity will continue for ever. They construed this to be a fee
simple; and yet, not entirely to disregard the intention of the donor, to be
a fee simple conditional; as if the words had been <i>to a man and his heirs</i>,
provided he have heirs of his body, and consequently to be alienable, and
forfeitable upon a certain event. And one great reason of making this
construction, I take to be the consideration of forfeiture for treason and
felony, which, by such grants, would be defeated by another construction,
and men thereby rendered more fearless to commit crimes in those troublesome
times<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.</p>

<p>Let us see then what estate or power was in <i>donor</i> and <i>donée</i> immediately
by the grant; and what, upon the performance of the condition, namely,
the having issue. And first, the <i>donée</i> had immediately a fee simple upon
the grant, contrary to Britton’s opinion, that, before children born, he had
only an estate for life, and afterwards a fee. This appears from hence,
that if a man had aliened in fee before issue had, the donor could not have
entered upon the lands for the forfeiture, which, if he was tenant for life,
he might. For the alienation in fee of tenant for life is an absolute forfeiture,
and gives right of entry to the <i>lessor</i>. The <i>donée</i>, then, having presently
a fee simple in him, that is, an estate for ever, than which there can
be no greater; it was impossible the donor should have any actual estate or
interest in the lands. He had not, therefore, a <i>reversion</i> vested in him, that
is, a certain positive right of the lands returning to him or his heirs, as he
would have had, if an estate for life only had been granted. He had only
a bare <i>possibility of reverter</i>, in case the donée died without issue; or, leaving
any, that issue had failed.</p>

<p>For the same reason, of the donée’s having a fee simple, no <i>remainder</i>
could be limited in such an estate. If land be given to A. for life or for
years, and after the efflux of the life or years to B., B. hath presently a remainder
in the lands for life, years, or in fee, according as the limitation of
the estate is; because it is certain that a life, or term of years, must expire.
But if land be given to A. and the heirs of his body, and, in failure of
such heirs, to B. and his heirs, this remainder to B., before the statute <i>De
Donis</i>, was void, for A. had immediately an estate for ever, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the limitation over to B. was rejected, as repugnant to the estate it depended
upon.</p>

<p>But though, by such a grant, the donée got a fee, it being clogged with
a condition, he had not, to all intents and purposes, an absolute power over
it, either with respect to the donor, or his own issue. If the donor aliened
before issue had, this was no bar to the donor, of his possibility of <i>reverter</i>;
but it was a bar to the issue born afterwards, to enjoy the estate tail. For
at this time fathers had a greater liberty to bar their children, than a stranger.
Therefore, in this case, the <i>alienée</i> and his heirs, were to enjoy the
lands while the donée, or any issue of his body remained. But whenever
they failed, the donor’s, or his heir’s possibility of reverter, was changed
into an actual reversion, and the land became his. For now, by a subsequent
event, it appeared, that the legal presumption of the estates continuing
for ever was ill founded. Neither, by the having of issue, was the
condition performed to all purposes, so as to vest an absolute fee in the
<i>donor</i>; for if the donée had died without issue, or if his issue failed, without
any alienation being made by either, in this case also, the donor’s possibility
was changed into an actual reversion. But by having issue, the
condition was so far performed, as to enlarge the power of the donée to
three special purposes; first, to alien absolutely, and thereby to destroy the
right of issue, and the possibility also of reverter in the donor; secondly, to
charge and incumber it to the prejudice of both issue and donor; and
thirdly, to forfeit it for treason or felony, to the prejudice of both also.
Such was the construction the judges made of these grants, which, we see,
gave, in almost all cases, an unlimited power of alienating, contrary to the
intention of the donor, and the form of the gift<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.</p>

<p>But, in the thirteenth of Edward the First, the lords, willing to preserve
the grandeur of their families, obtained of that monarch the famous
statute of Westminster the second, called <i>De Donis</i>, which by these words,
<i>quod voluntas donatoris, secundum formam in charta Doni sui, manifeste expressam,
de cætero observetur, ita quod non habeant illi, quibus tenementum sic fuit
datum sub conditione, potestatem alienandi tenemenium sic datum, quo minus ad
exitum illorum, quibus tenementum sic fuerit datum, remaneat post eorum obitum,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
vel ad donatorem vel ad ejus hæredem, si exitus deficiat, revertatur</i><a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>, created
a new kind of inheritance, <i>estates tail</i>, which very much resemble the old
feudal donations, that were only descendible to the issue of the first feudatory.
Let us see the consequence of these words. First, since the will of
the donor was to be observed, it followed, that neither the donée, nor his
issue, should have power to alien, incumber, or forfeit: the consequence
of which was, that he could no longer have a fee simple, as these are inseparable
incidents to such an estate; but a lesser estate, called <i>Fee tail</i>, from,
the French word <i>Tailler</i> before mentioned, as being, like other lesser estates,
carved out of the fee simple.</p>

<p>Were it to be asked, in whom did the fee simple reside? it is plain it
could be in none other but the donor, who had it originally in him.
Therefore, by this statute, the possibility of reverter, which the donor had,
was changed into an actual present interest, called a <i>reversion in fee simple</i>.
But it was not always necessary that the fee simple should be in the donor;
for estates tail, being now less than a fee simple, it became possible to limit
a remainder thereon which should be good: Thus, if a gift be made
to A. and the heirs of his body, and, in failure of such heirs, to B. and his
heirs; in this case, there is no reversion: for the donor hath parted with his
whole estate, but A. hath an estate tail, and B. a remainder in fee simple.
Many remainders may be limited on one another, as for instance, an estate
may be given to A. for years, remainder to B. for life, remainder to C. in
tail, remainder to D. in tail, remainder to E. in fee simple; but if the last
remainder is not in fee simple, but in fee tail, then is the reversion in fee
simple to the donor.</p>

<p>However, although a tenant in tail after this statute could alien only for
his own life, his heir in tail was not allowed to enter upon the alienée without
first proving his right in a court of law, and this is what is meant by
saying, <i>though a tenant in tail could not destroy the estate tail by his alienation,
yet he could continue it</i>. The reason of this is, that all estates of inheritance
are presumed fee simple, until the contrary is proved, and it would be unjust
to remove a possessor, who came in by a title apparently fair, until the
weakness of that title appears judicially. This rule, however, extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
only to estates corporeal, that lay in liveries, not to incorporeal ones, that lay
in grant; which shews that this maxim of its working a discontinuance proceeded
from the feudal principle, of protecting the possessor, because he
was to do the feudal duties.</p>

<p>The statute to guard these inheritances from alienations, expressly provides,
that even a fine levied of them in the king’s courts of record should
be <i>ipso jure</i> null.</p>

<p>The method of recovering such lands so discontinued, is by a writ called
a <i>Formedon</i>, from the words <i>forma doni</i>, of which writ there are three kinds,
according to the title of the persons who bring them; <i>formedon, in the reverter</i>,
<i>in the descender</i>, and <i>in the remainder</i>. <i>Formedon in the reverter</i> lies for the
donor or his heirs, and lay at the common law after the failure of issue, where
the alienation was before issue had; but since the statute, upon the failure
of issue, it lies, though the alienation be after. <i>Formedon in descender</i> lies for
the issue in tail, when the ancestor has aliened, and is given by the statute.
The form of it is as follows, “The king to the sheriff of ⸺ greeting, command
A. that he justly, and without delay, restore to B. such a manor,
&amp;c. which C. gave to D., and the heirs of his body, and which, after
the death of the said D., ought to descend to the said B. the son of the
said D. by the form of the aforesaid gift, as he says.” <i>Formedon in remainder</i>
lies for a remainder man in tail, or his issue, after the particular estate
previous to his (whether it be for years, life, or in tail) is spent. In the reverter,
instead of the word <i>descend</i>, it is <i>revert</i>; in the remainder, <i>remain</i><a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.</p>

<p>Having shewn the origin of estates tail, I shall next consider their consequences,
and future fortune.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The consequences and history of estates Tail.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The following are the words of my lord Coke. “When all estates
were fee simple, then were purchasers sure of their purchases,
farmers of their leases, creditors of their debts; the king and lords had
their escheats, forfeitures, wardships, and other profits of their seignories:
and for these, and other like cases, by the wisdom of the common law, all
estates of inheritance were fee simple; and what contentions and mischiefs
have crept into the quiet of the law by these fettered inheritances,
daily experience teacheth us.” By this enumeration of his, of the advantages
that attended estates of fee simple, it is easy to see who were the
sufferers, and wherein they suffered, by the introduction of estates tail.
But it is a little surprizing that he should make such a slip as to say, that before
this creditors were secure of their debts by all estates being fee simple;
when the first statute that gave them any hold of lands was made after this
statute <i>De Donis</i>, in the latter end of the same year of the king’s reign, the
thirteenth of Edward the First. Those, indeed, who had landed estates at
that time, and their posterity, were great gainers hereby; but the king and
the nation in general were sufferers. The nation suffered by the check that
commerce, then just arising, received, by so much lands becoming unalienable,
and the crown suffered in a double respect; first by the opportunity
it afforded to strengthen and explain the great estates of the lords, and secondly
by the security it gave when enlarged.</p>

<p>Soon after the conquest, the estates of the English lords were enormous.
William brought over an army of 60,000 men, not levied by himself, (for
he was unable to raise or defray the expences of a third of that number, out
of the province of Normandy,) but consisting chiefly of adventurers, who
engaged in the expedition on the promise of forfeited lands, in proportion
to the numbers they brought with them. Accordingly, some had seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
hundred manors, others five, four, three, two, one hundred, or less; insomuch,
that all the lands of England, (if we except the king’s demesnes,
the church lands, and the little properties annexed to cities and boroughs)
were in no more than about seven hundred hands, the principal of which
were petty princes, like the dukes and counts of France<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>.</p>

<p>William was sensible, from the experience of that country, how dangerous
such large grants would prove to the authority of the crown, and he
accordingly moderated them as well as his circumstances would permit.
That the king might not be too far removed from the view of the lower
people, by the interposition of the great lords, their immediate superiors,
he did not, as in France, leave the whole judicial power, and the profits of
the county courts in the earls; but justice was administered in the king’s
name by his sheriffs; who, as being deputies of the earls, were called <i>Vice
Comites</i>, and who accounted for the profits to the king, except as for the
one third, which in England was the earl’s proportion; and in after times,
upon new creations, the third also was referred to the king, and only a certain
stipend out of it, generally twenty pounds a year, assigned to the earl<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.</p>

<p>Another means he used of disarming them of the too great powers immoderate
estates would have given them, was avoiding the rock the French
court had split on, the giving vast territories, lying contiguous to each
other, in fief, whereby all the followers were immediately in the view and at
the call of the lords. William acted more prudently. He generally gave to
an earl twenty knights fees, which was the proportion of an English earldom
in the county, whose title he bore; perhaps thirteen, or a barony, in another
county; and the remainder, he was to give, either in baronies in distant
counties, or more generally in single knights fees, dispersed through all England.
This was his general method, except to a few of his near relations,
to whom he gave palatinates with <i>jura regalia</i>, which were exactly in the nature
of the French dutchies and counties<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.</p>

<p>Another prudent step he took for the benefit of his successors, was the
making all his grants <i>feminine fiefs</i>. For as, in a course of several descents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
it must happen that lineal males would frequently fail, by admitting the
daughters in that case, these vast inheritances were frequently broken, as
females succeeded equally. His successors followed his plan, and for that
purpose, not only permitted, but encouraged their great vassals to alien,
and dismember their properties; and whenever a great escheat fell, were
always sure, unless there was a prince of the blood to be provided for, to
divide it into many hands.</p>

<p>Both kings and people received the advantages, and would have received
more, if this policy had continued. The immediate tenants of the
crown being encreased in number, and lessened in wealth, were not able to
confederate so easily against the crown; and, sensible of their being weakened,
had occasion for the support of the lower rank of the people, whom,
consequently, they treated with more gentleness and equality than before.
But this statute of entails put a stop to the progress that course of things
were in; estates became unalienable, and indivisible. The property of no
lord could lessen; and if it happened, as it frequently did, that they acquired,
either by descent or marriage, or the purchase of an estate not tied up,
a new entail connected it inseparately with the old one; and thus the lords,
towards the end of the Plantagenet line, grew up to such a pitch of power,
as was dangerous to the constitution, and when they were divided into the
factions of the York and Lancaster, deluged the land with blood.</p>

<p>The king saw the mischief betimes, but the mischief was done. The
act was passed, and to get it repealed was impossible. They had nothing
left, but to find means to elude it by construction of law, wherever they
could. The scheme was readily embraced by the judges and lawyers, who
had raised great outcries against these fettered inheritances, and were joined
by all the trading and industrious people, and even by the younger branches
of these great families, whose fathers were thereby disabled to provide for
them.</p>

<p>The first means found out was by <i>collateral warranty</i>. Before this statute
all warranties by an ancestor bound the heir at law, although no land descended
from that ancestor, upon the presumption that no man would disinherit
his heir, without leaving him a recompence. But this could be no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
longer the law in general; for, if so, the ancestor in tail might, by his
warranty, defeat the tail, contrary to the statute, which says, <i>The will of
the donor shall be observed</i>. They therefore made now a distinction between
a lineal warranty and a <i>collateral</i> one. Lineal warranty is that which is made
by tenants in tail; collateral, that which is made by one who is a stranger
to the entail. In the first case they held it no bar, unless assets descended;
that is, an estate in fee simple, equal in value. But in the latter case, that
no assets descended, they held it at bar as at common law<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.</p>

<p>To illustrate this by an example, If lands are given to A. and the heirs
male of his body, and A. aliens with warranty, this is lineal warranty, and
shall not bind the son; but if B. the brother of A. who has nothing to say
to the entail, joins in the alienation with warranty, or releases to the alienee
with warranty, or disseizes A, and then aliens with warranty, and dies without
issue, so that A’s son is his heir, this warranty is collateral to the entail,
and without assets should bind the son of A, as at common law. At first
view it may seem surprising how this construction gained ground against the
express words of the statute, <i>Voluntas donatoris de cætero observetur</i>; for the
will of the donor was certainly as much defeated by a collateral, as by a
lineal warranty; but the judges took advantage of the preamble of the
act, which, reciting the mischief, speaks only of the alienation of the tenant
in tail, that is, of lineal warranty. They restrained, therefore, out of disfavour
to these fettered estates, the general words in the enacting part, to
the particular case mentioned in the preamble, on this ground, that the
common law was not to be altered without it appeared undeniable that the
legislator intended it; and here, as to collateral alienation, they are silent.
This was the first device used to defeat estates tail, namely, by getting a
collateral relation, whose heir the issue in tail was to be, to concur in the
alienation, and to bind himself and heirs to warranty; which was generally
obtained for a small consideration, as such person could never be a gainer
by the estate tail, since it could in no case come to him.</p>

<p>When once this rule of collateral warranty barring an estate tail, was
settled, attempts were made to prevent its taking effect, and to continue
such estate notwithstanding. Jude Richel, in Richard the Second’s time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
led the way; he having settled lands on his eldest son in tail; remainder to
his second son in tail; adds, that the lands are given on this condition,
that, if the eldest son should alien, that instant his estate should cease and
determine, and the land remain to the second son and the heirs of his body.
Here he imagined he had got clear of collateral warranty, because the first
estate was to determine, and the second to commence immediately on the
alienation, and before any collateral warranty could descend on the second.
But the judges determined this condition to be void; for which Littleton
gives three reasons, drawn rather from the art of law, than from the principles
of plain reason<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. The true ground seems to be this:</p>

<p>In every reign, from Edward the First down to Edward the Fourth, bills
were brought into parliament to repeal the statute <i>De Donis</i>, as Coke informs
us, but had constantly miscarried, as the estates of the majority in parliament
were entailed. The only relief found out at that time against their
mischiefs was this collateral warranty; and if Richel’s conditions were to
be adjudged good, all estates tail would have been made with such conditions,
and there would have been an end of that method of defeating them.
The same was the fate of a similar settlement of Judge Thirning, who took
the advice of his cotemporary judges, in wording his condition so as to
make it effectual; but their successors were of a different opinion, and rejected
it. However, these collateral warranties not being to be got in all
cases, the relief was but partial, and extended only to particular cases.
And the tenant in tail himself could by no act of his, in concurrence
with any other person, except a collateral ancestor of the issue in tail, bar
them.</p>

<p>At length the judges found out a device, by a fiction in law, to enable
him to bar his issue, and all remainders, and reversions. A. brings his
action real against B, tenant in tail, and alledges the lands in tail to be his
A’s right and inheritance, when in truth he hath no title thereto; B. comes
in, and voucheth C. to warranty, who enters into warranty, and after,
when he should defend, makes default, so judgment is given for A. against
B. and for B. to recover in value against C. Here, though C. has no land
to render in value, the judges have construed B, and all that should come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
after him, to be barred; because if C. ever after purchased lands, these
lands might be recovered from him, by virtue of the former judgment;
and so there was a possibility of a recompence. Though this decision at
first created great outcries, and even in Henry the Eighth’s reign was but
weakly defended in equity and conscience, by the author of <i>Doctor and Student</i>,
yet the judges, for the public good, constantly adhering to it, and
these common recoveries being taken notice of and approved of by subsequent
acts of parliament, are at length grown to be common assurances of
lands, and, passing in the court of record, are the best securities of estates<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.</p>

<p>The bearing of estates tail, <i>by fine</i> passed in the king’s courts, grew up
another way, and is founded on an act of parliament in Henry the Seventh’s
reign, and is indeed, properly speaking, a partial repeal of the statute <i>De
Donis</i>, since it puts it in the tenant in tail’s power to destroy it, by observing
certain solemnities. Though common recoveries had been invented
some years before, yet as they had not had time to grow up to such a degree
of firmness as to be sufficiently depended upon, their legality was still
doubted, and it was not certain that future judges would give them the
same construction which their predecessors had done. Therefore, that politic
prince Henry the Seventh, who saw, in all its lights, that superiority
which the preservation of landed property in their families gave to the nobles,
a superiority which had cost some of his predecessors their lives and
crowns, freed lawyers from the trouble of inventing future devices against
entails, by getting the famous act passed in the fourth year of his reign,
which made a fine, with proclamations to conclude all persons, strangers as
well as privies<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.</p>

<p>It was the purport of, and so it is expressed in the statute <i>De Donis</i>, that
a fine levied of entailed lands should be <i>ipso jure</i> null, and it is the intent of
this act, on the contrary, that a fine, levied with the prescribed solemnity,
should be valid to bar the persons therein intended to be barred. There is
a clause, indeed, in this act, saving the right and interests of all persons,
which accrued after the ingrossing of the fine, they pursuing their rights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
within a certain time after they accrued. This clause was apparently thrown
in to make the act pass, and to deceive the enactors into an opinion, that it
would not affect estates tail; and on this clause a doubt occurred in that
reign, whether the issue of tenant in tail could be barred by this statute, and
that, notwithstanding by the tenor of it, privies were barred. The question
was, whether the statute meant privies to the fine, or privies to the estate of
the person levying it? The issue were not privies in the first sense, but were
in the latter. The judges embraced the opportunity this ambiguity gave
them, of defeating entails, and bound the issue by the fine. A statute of
the succeeding prince approved of that construction, gave it retrospect, and
prevented all ambiguity for the future<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus were estates tail no longer certain perpetuities, but defeasible upon
performing certain requisite solemnities. Still however they continued not
to be forfeitable for crimes, which was a point not to be got over without
an act of parliament, and there was little likelihood of obtaining such an
one; but Henry the Eighth snatched the lucky opportunity his situation
gave him, of gaining this important point, in the 26th year of his reign,
when he had quarrelled with the Pope, and all hope of accommodation
vanished; when a sentence of excommunication was denounced against
him, and numbers of his subjects, many of them of great fortunes, bigotedly
attached to the old religion, were known to meditate rebellion. The
parliament, the majority of which were of the new profession, seeing no
other means to preserve the security of the state, and the protestant religion,
yielded at length to the passing of an act for that purpose<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>However, there were not wanting persons after this, willing to create
perpetuities, in which they were always disappointed by the decision of the
judges. The first device was by giving estates upon condition, that if tenants
in tail should levy a fine, or suffer a recovery, the estate should cease,
and go over to the next issue intitled. But the judges rejected such condition,
for the same reason as in Richel’s case. They adjudged the right of
barring by a fine or recovery to be an incident inseparable to a fee tail, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
all conditions repugnant thereto idle and void; for how could the law suffer
that an estate, by previous act of the donor, should, upon a judgment at
law, become vested in any other person than him who recovered? These
ingenious conveyancers, finding that the limitation upon breach of the condition
came too late, as the estate had already gone in another channel,
framed the condition thus; that <i>if tenant in tail should go about to levy</i>, &amp;c.
<i>or make any covenant to levy, or hold any communication about levying</i>, &amp;c. <i>the
estate should then</i>, &amp;c. But these were all condemned upon the old principle,
and still more for their vagueness and uncertainty.</p>

<p><i>The constitution of a feudal monarchy—The dignity and revenues of the King—An
examination of his power as to the raising of taxes and subsidies.</i></p>

</div>

<p>As, in my former lectures, I drew a general sketch of the nature and
form of the governments that prevailed among the northern nations
whilst they remained in Germany, and what alterations ensued on their being
removed within the limits of the Roman empire, it will be now proper
to shew, in as brief a manner as may consist with clearness, the nature and
constitution of a feudal monarchy, when estates were become hereditary,
the several constituent parts thereof, and what were the chief of the peculiar
rights and privileges of each part. This research will be of use, not only to
understand our present constitution, which is derived from thence, but to
make us admire and esteem it, when we compare it with that which was its
original, and observe the many improvements it has undergone. From
hence, likewise, may be determined that famous question, whether our
kings were originally absolute, and all our privileges only concessions of
theirs; or whether the chief of them are not originally inherent rights, and
coeval with the monarchy; not, indeed, in all the subjects, for that, in old
times, was not the case, but in all that were <i>freemen</i>, and, as all are such
now, do consequently belong to all.</p>

<p>To begin with the king, the head of the political body. His dignity
and power were great, but not absolute and unlimited. Indeed, it was impossible,
in the nature of things, even if it had been declared so by law,
that it could have continued in that state, when he had no standing force,
and the sword was in the hand of the people. And yet it must be owned
his dignity was so high, as to give a superficial observer some room, if he
is partially inclined, to lean to that opinion. All the lands in his dominions
were holden of him. For, by degrees, the <i>allodia</i> had been changed into,
and supposed to have been derived from, his original grant, and consequently
revertible to him. But then, the land proprietors had (on fulfilling the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
conditions they were bound to) a secure and permanent interest in their
possessions. He could neither take them away at pleasure, nor lay taxes or
talliages on them by arbitrary will, which would have been little different.
Since, in Magna Charta, we find the people insisting that the king had no
right to assess the quantity of escuage, which was a pecuniary commutation
for military service, nor to lay talliages on his other subjects, but that both
must be done in parliament. He was a necessary party to the making new
laws, and to the changing and abrogating old ones; and from him they received
their binding force, insomuch that many old laws, tho’ passed in parliament,
run in the king’s name only. For, in those days, persons were
more attentive to substance than forms; and it was not then even suspected,
in any nation of Europe, that any king would arrogate to himself a
power so inconsistent with the original freedom of the German nations.
Nay, in France, to this day, the king’s edicts are not laws, until registered
in parliament, which implies the consent of the people, tho’ that consent is
too often extorted by the violent power that monarch has assumed over the
persons and liberty of the members of that body<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.</p>

<p>The dignity of the king was supported, in the eyes of the people, not
only by the splendor of his royalty, but by the lowly reverence paid him
by the greatest of his lords. At solemn feasts they waited on him on the
knee, or did other menial offices about his person, as their tenures required,
and did their homage and fealty with the same lowly and humiliating
circumstances that the meanest of their vassals paid to them. His person
likewise was sacred, and guarded by the law, which inflicted the most
horrible punishment for attempts against him; neither was he to be resisted,
or accountable for any private injury done personally by himself, on any
account whatsoever. For the state thought it better to suffer a few personal
wrongs to individuals, than to endanger the safety of the whole, by
rendering the head insecure.</p>

<p>But the greatest of the kingly power consisted in his being entirely entrusted
with the executive part of the government, both at home and abroad.
At home justice was administered in his name, and by officers of his appointment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
He had, likewise, the disposal of all the great offices of the
state, with an exception of such as had been granted by his predecessors in
fee, and of all other offices and employments exercised in the kingdom immediately
under him. Abroad he made war and peace, treaties, and truces
as he pleased. He led his armies in person, or appointed commanders;
and exercised, in time of war, that absolute power over his armies that is
essential to their preservation and discipline. But how was he enabled to
support the expence of the government, or to provide for the defence of
the kingdom, or carry on a foreign war; since, if he was not furnished in
that respect, these high-sounding prerogatives had been but empty names,
and the state might have perished? and if he could at pleasure levy the necessary
sums, he being sole judge of the necessity, both as to occasion and
quantity, as Charles the First claimed in the case of ship-money, the state of
the subject was precarious, and the king would have been as absolute a monarch
as the present king of France or Spain<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>But abundant provision was made on this head, and that without over-burdening
the subject, for supporting the ordinary expences of the government.
A vast demesne was set apart to the king, amounting, in England,
to one thousand four hundred and twenty-two manors, as also many other
lands, which had not been erected into manors. Besides these, he had the
profits of all his feudal tenures, his worships, marriages, and reliefs; the
benefit of escheats, either upon failure of heirs or forfeiture; the goods of
felons and traitors; the profits of his courts of justice; besides many other
casualties, which amounted to an immense revenue; insomuch, that, we
are informed, that William the Conqueror had L. 1061: 10s. a-day, that is,
allowing for the comparative value of money, near four millions a-year;
so that Fortescue might well say, that, originally, the king of England was
the richest king in Europe. Such a sum was not only sufficient for the occasions
of peace, but out of it he might spare considerably for the exigencies
of war<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.</p>

<p>This revenue, however great, was not sufficient to support a war of any
importance and continuance, besides the extraordinary expence of government.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
It remains, therefore, to see what provision this constitution made,
in addition to what the monarch might spare, for the defence of England,
as it might be attacked either by land or sea. For the former, every sea-port
was, in proportion to its ability, obliged to find, in time of danger, at
their own expence, one or more ships properly furnished with men and
arms; which, joined to such other ships as the king hired, were, in general,
an overmatch for the invaders. But if the enemy had got footing in
the country, the defence at land was by the knights or military tenants,
who were obliged to serve on horseback in any part of England; and by
the socage tenants, or infantry, who, in case of invasion, were likewise
obliged to serve, but not out of their own country, unless they themselves
pleased, and then they were paid by the king.</p>

<p>With respect to carrying on <i>offensive</i> war into the enemy’s country, the
king of England had great advantages over any other feudal monarch. In
the other feudal kingdoms the military vassals were not obliged to serve in
any offensive war, unless it was just, the determination of which point was
in themselves; but William the Conqueror obliged all to whom he gave
tenures to serve him <i>ubicunque</i>; and though he had not above three hundred,
if so many, immediate military tenants under him, yet these were
obliged, on all occasions, to furnish sixty thousand knights compleatly
equipped, and ready to serve forty days at their own expence. If he wanted
their service longer, he was obliged to obtain it on what terms he could.
There is, therefore, no reason to wonder that the king of England, though
master of so comparatively small a territory, was, in general, an overmatch,
in those early times, for the power of France. As for <i>infantry</i> in his foreign
wars, he had none obliged to attend him. Those he had were socage tenants,
whose services were certain; so that he was obliged to engage, and
pay them, as hired soldiers. As the socage tenants in his dominions had a
good share of property, and enjoyed it without oppression, it is no wonder
the English archers in those days had a gallant spirit, and were as redoubtable
as the English infantry is at present.</p>

<p>To support these military tenants, who served after the necessary time,
and likewise his infantry (as the surplus of his ordinary revenue would not
suffice) he had <i>customs</i> and <i>talliages</i>, and <i>aids</i> and <i>subsidies</i> granted by parliament.
These customs, or so much paid by merchants on the exportation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
of goods, were of two kinds; as paid either by <i>merchant strangers</i>, or by
<i>merchant denizens</i><a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.</p>

<p>The customs paid by merchant strangers were not originally settled by
act of parliament, but by a compact between the merchant strangers and
king Edward the First. In the Saxon times the king had a power of excluding
strangers from his kingdom, not merely with an intention of inducing
their own people to traffick, but chiefly to keep out the Danes, who
were the masters of the sea; lest, under pretence of trade, they might get
footing in, and become acquainted with the state of the kingdom. They
were, accordingly, admitted by the kings upon such terms as the latter
were pleased to impose; but Edward, who had the success and prosperity
of his kingdom at heart, came to a perpetual composition with them; gave
them several privileges, and they gave to him certain customs in return.
What shews they had their origin from consent is, that the king could not
raise them without applying to parliament. The customs of natives or
denizens were, certainly, first given to the king by parliament; though
this has been denied by some, merely because no such act is to be found,
as if many of the antient acts had not been lost; but there are acts and
charters still extant, which expressly say they were appointed and granted
by parliament, without the power of which they could not be either altered
or enlarged.</p>

<p>The difference between the customs and the other aids I have mentioned,
<i>viz.</i> talliages and subsidies, is, that the latter were occasional,
granted only on particular emergencies, whereas the <i>customs</i> were for ever.
If it be asked how they came to be granted in that manner, we must refer
back to the original state of boroughs and their inhabitants, traders, in the
feudal law. In France, the Roman towns were taken into protection, and
had their antient privileges allowed them; but in the series of wars that
happened in that country for ages, every one of them in their turns were
stormed, and reduced to vassalage, either to the king or some other great
lord; and as, now, these lords had learned that the Roman emperor laid
on taxes at his pleasure, it was but natural they should claim the same right,
especially over towns they had taken in war. The burgesses, therefore, became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
in the nature of villains, not indeed of common villains, for that
would absolutely have destroyed trade, but with respect to arbitrary taxation,
which, however, if the lord was wise, was never exorbitant. In England,
I apprehend, they became villains; for the Saxons were a murdering
race, and extirpated the old inhabitants. However, wise kings, considering
the advantages of commerce, by degrees, bestowed privileges on certain
places, in order to render them flourishing and wealthy; and at length, about
the time of Magna Charta, or before, when every uncertain service was varying
to a certainty, this privilege was obtained for merchant adventurers.
But the other burgesses, that did not import or export, and likewise villains,
were still talliageable at will. This was restrained by Magna Charta, which
declares all talliages unlawful, unless ordained by parliament<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.</p>

<p>To come to the latter head, whether taxes, aids, and subsidies can be
assessed by the king, as sole judge of the occasion, and the <i>quantum</i>—or
whether they must be granted by parliament, was the great and principal
contest between the two first princes of the unfortunate house of Stuart and
their people, and which, concurring with other causes, cost the last of them
his life and throne. To say nothing of the divine hereditary right urged on
the king’s behalf, and which, if examined into strictly, no royal family in
Europe had less pretensions to claim, both sides referred themselves to the
antient constitution for the decision of this point. The king’s friends urged
that all lands were holden from him by services, and that this was one of
his prerogatives, and a necessary one to the defence of the state. They
produced several instances of its having been done, and submitted to, not
only in the times of the worst, but of some of the best kings; and as to
acts of parliament against it, they were extorted from the monarchs in particular
exigencies, and could not bind their successors, as their right was
from God.</p>

<p>The advocates of the people, on the other hand, insisted, that, in England,
as in all other feudal countries, the right of the king was founded on
compact; that William the Conqueror was not master of all the lands in
England, nor did he give them on these terms; that he claimed no right
but what the Saxon kings had, and this they certainly had not; that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
established and confirmed the Saxon laws, except such as were by parliament
altered; that he gave away none but the forfeited lands, and gave
them on the same terms as they were generally given in feudal countries,
where such a power was in those days unknown. They admitted, that, in
fact, the kings of England had sometimes exercised this power, and that,
on some occasions, the people submitted to it. But they insisted, that most
of the kings that did it were oppressors of the worst kind in all respects;
that the subjects, even in submitting, insisted on their ancient rights and
freedom, and every one of these princes afterwards retracted, and confessed
they had done amiss. If one or two of the best and wisest of their kings
had practised this, they insisted that their ancestors acquiescence once or
twice, in the measures of a prince they had absolute confidence in, and at
times when the danger, perhaps, was so imminent as to stare every man in
the face, (for it was scarce ever done by a good prince) as when there was
not a fleet already assembled in the ports of France to waft over an army,
should not be considered as conveying a right to future kings indiscriminately,
as a surrender of their important privileges of taxation. They insisted
that these good and wise kings had acknowledged the rights of the people;
that they excused what they had done, as extorted by urgent necessity, for
the preservation of the whole; that, by repeated acts of parliament, they had
disavowed this power, and declared such proceedings should never be drawn
into precedent. They observed, that there was no occasion for the vast
demesne of the king, if he had this extraordinary prerogative to exert whenever
he pleased. They denied the king’s divine right to the succession of
the crown, and that absolute unlimited authority that was deduced from it.
They insisted that he was a king by compact, that his succession depended
on that compact, though they allowed that a king intitled by that compact,
and acting according to it, has a divine right of government, as every
legal and righteous magistrate hath. They inferred, therefore, that he was
a limited monarch, and consequently that he and his successors were bound
by the legislative, the supreme authority<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.</p>

<p>The advocates of the king treated the original compact as a chimera, and
desired them to produce it; which the other side thought an unreasonable
demand, as it was, they alledged, transacted when both king and people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
were utterly illiterate. They thought the utmost proof possible was given
by quoting the real acts of authority, which the Saxon kings had exercised;
among which this was not to be found; that the Norman kings, though
some of them had occasionally practised it, had, in general, both bad and
good princes, afterwards disclaimed the right, and that it never had (though
perhaps submitted to in one or two instances) been given up by their
ancestors, who always, and even to the face of their best princes, insisted
that it was an encroachment on those franchises they were intitled to by
their birthright.</p>

<p>Such, in general, were the principles on which the arguments were
maintained on both sides: for to go into <i>minutiæ</i>, would not consist with
the design of this undertaking. I apprehend it will be evident from this
detail of mine, though I protest I designed to represent both sides fairly,
that I am inclined to the people in this question. I own I think that any
one that considers impartially the few monuments that remain of the old
Saxon times, either in their laws or histories, the constant course since the
conquest, and the practice of nations abroad, who had the same feudal
policy, must acknowledge, that though this right was claimed and exercised
by John, Henry the Third, Edward the First, Second, and Third, Richard
the Second, and Henry the Eighth, it was in the event disclaimed by every
one of them, by the greatest of our kings, Edward the First and Third,
and Henry the Eighth, with such candour and free will, as inforced confidence
in them; by the others, in truth, because they could not help it. I
hope I shall stand excused, if I add, that the majority of those who engaged
in the civil war, either for king Charles, or against him, were of the same
opinion. For, had he not given up this point, (and indeed he did it with
all the appearances of the greatest sincerity) he would not have got three
thousand men to appear for him in the field. But, unfortunately for his
family, and us, (for we still feel the effects of it from the popish education
his offspring got abroad) his concession came too late. He had lost the
confidence of too many of his people, and a party of republicans were
formed; all reasonable securities were certainly given; but upon pretence
that he could not be depended upon, his enemies prevailed on too many to
insist on such conditions, as would have left him but a king in name, and
unhinged the whole frame of government. Thus the partizans of absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
monarchy on one side, and the republicans, with a parcel of crafty ambitious
men, who for their own private views affected that character, on the
other, rented the kingdom between them, and obliged the honest, and the
friends to the old constitution, to take side either with one party or other,
and they were accordingly, for their moderation and desire of peace, and a
legal settlement, equally despised which ever they joined with<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall make but one observation more; that though it is very false reasoning
to argue from events when referred to the decision of God, as to the
matter of right in question; I cannot help being struck with observing, that
though this has been a question of five hundred years standing in England,
the decision of providence hath constantly been in favour of the people. If
it has been so in other countries for two hundred or two hundred and fifty
years past, which is the utmost, let us investigate the causes of the difference,
and act accordingly. The ancients tell us it is impossible that a brave and
virtuous nation can ever be slaves, and, on the contrary, that no nation that
is cowardly, or generally vitious, can be free. Let us bless God, who hath
for so long a time favoured these realms. Let us act towards the family
that reigns over us, as becomes free subjects, to the guardians of liberty,
and of the natural rights to mankind; but above all, let us train posterity,
so as to be deserving of the continuance of these blessings, that Montesquieu’s
prophecy<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> may never appear to be justly founded.</p>

<p>“England (says he) in the course of things, <i>must</i> lose her liberties,
and then she will be a greater slave than any of her neighbours.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>The King’s power as to the making, repealing, altering, or dispensing with laws.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having, in the last lecture, begun to draw the outlines of a feudal
monarchy, particularly, as it antiently was in England, in order that
it may be more easy to understand the nature of our present constitution;
and to see how far, and in what particulars, it has deviated from its original,
either for the better, or the worse; and having, for that purpose, begun
with the regal prerogatives, and particularly with that important one,
the raising of money, it will be proper to proceed to the king’s power as to
the <i>laws</i>, either in the making, repealing, altering, or dispensing with them:
for these powers are now exercised by the sovereigns in almost all the monarchies
that were antiently feudal, and have been claimed likewise in England.
That this power could not originally have been in the king, in any
feudal state, is plain from the detail I have given of the old German governments,
and of the gradual progress and formation of the European
kingdoms from thence; and it would not only be an entertaining, but useful
study for gentlemen of fortune, to trace, through the history of every nation,
the several steps whereby the liberties of the people have been undermined,
until the whole power hath settled in the monarch; but I shall content
myself with a few observations on this subject, drawn from the History
of England, and such as, in my apprehension, will be sufficient to settle
this point as to us.</p>

<p>If the monarchies on the continent were not absolute in this respect, much
less could the Saxon kings pretend to such a power, from the very nature of
the foundation of their kingdoms. The Franks, the Goths, the Burgundians,
and others on the continent, were led to conquest by those who had
been previously their kings, and who had a stable and settled authority over
them. Very different was the settlement of the Saxons in Britain. Neither
Hengist, nor any of their first kings, had been kings in Germany. They
were mere leaders of companies of freebooters, who had associated themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
first for plunder, and afterwards to fix themselves in new seats, in
imitation of the other German nations. Their leaders, therefore, could
have no powers, but what were conferred upon them by their followers;
and that <i>law-making</i> was not one of those powers, appears from the frequent
meetings of their <i>witenagemots</i>, which was the name they gave to
their general assemblies, or parliaments; and from all the laws of theirs
now extant being made in them. It was the boast of the good and wise
king Alfred, that “he left the people of England as free as the internal
thoughts of man,” a speech which could never have proceeded from the
mouth of one who had the least notion of the almighty power of kings over
the laws. His successors were of the same opinion. The law of Edward
the Confessor, which was ratified by the Conqueror, says, <i>Debet rex omnia
rite facere in regno, &amp; per judicium procerum regni</i>, and if <i>omnia</i>, surely the
making and repealing of laws, the most important of all<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.</p>

<p>Our historians and records from that time down undeniably shew who,
in every age, were the legislators, and that the kings alone were not so.
The same is expressly delivered by all the old writers on the law, Glanville,
Bracton, Britton, Fleta and Fortescue. Nay, some of them, in their zeal
for liberty, have gone so far, as to pervert the meaning of the civil law,
which, in their time, was in high repute, and to deny the absolute power of
legislation to the Roman emperor. The civil law says, <i>Quod principi placet
legis habet vigorem</i>; but how doth Bracton comment upon it? <i>Id est non
quicquid de voluntate regis temere præsumptum est, sed animo condendi jura, sed
quod consilio magistratuum suorum, rege auctoritatem præstante, &amp; habita super
hoc deliberatione &amp; tractatu, recte fuerit definitum<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</i></p>

<p>It must, however, be owned that many of our princes were very desirous
of assuming this power. In the reign of our Henry the First, a perfect
copy of the civil law being discovered at Amalfi, the princes of Europe
got an idea of a monarchy more powerful and absolute than either kings
or people had for many centuries before any notion of; and they were, in
general, desirous enough to stretch, if they could, their limited prerogative
to the height of the antient imperial despotism; but to do this by their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
authority was impossible. A wiser way was pursued. The excellency of
this law was, on every occasion, extolled, not only as providing remedies,
and determining, in many cases, where the feudal customs were silent, but
on account also of its justice and equity; praises that, it must be owned, do
belong to this law where the absolute authority of the prince is not concerned.
Foundations for the teaching this law were established in all the
universities, and the proficients therein were sure of ample encouragement<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>The popes, likewise, who wanted to set themselves up in the seat of the
old emperors, contributed not a little, in those days of ignorance, to spread
it; so that it is not wonderful that it got ground in every country almost
on the continent; and being melted into, and conjoined with the feudal,
customs, contributed not a little to the destruction of the freedom of the antient
constitutions. The same method was attempted in England, but not
with the like success. The foundation of professorships, the introducing
that law, and its forms, into the courts that were more immediately under
the king’s influence, as the courts of the constable, the admiral, and of the
universities, and the high employments its professors obtained, sufficiently
shew the fondness many of our kings had for it. But the common lawyers
and parliament perceived the design, and foresaw the consequences that
might follow. Their opposition was steady and successful; and if they did
not banish it from the courts wherein it had got footing, at least they so limited
and circumscribed it, as to prevent its future progress.</p>

<p>The kings who had any wisdom or prudence, in order to dissemble their
real design, gave way to these restrictions, and waited for more favourable
opportunities; but the imprudent and haughty Richard the Second avowed
himself an open patron to this law. When the duke of Ireland, the archbishop
of York, and others his minions, were accused in parliament of high
treason, and the evidence being known to be so full as that they must be
convicted, he made this weak attempt to screen them. He got his judges,
who were his creatures, to declare the proceedings against these persons null
and void, as not being regulated according to the forms prescribed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
civil law: but the barons, provoked at such a bare-faced attempt, insisted
they were regular, as agreeable to their own customs, and declared positively
they would never suffer England to be governed by the Roman civil law,
and passed sentence of high treason against the judges<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>

<p>Whence that king’s fondness for this law arose, may be seen from the
use he put it to, the protection of the instruments of his tyrannical administration;
and from the many wild and unguarded declarations he made,
especially that relative to his commons, <i>that slaves they were, and slaves they
should be</i>, and to his parliament, <i>that he would not at their request discharge the
meanest scullion in his kitchen</i>. But tho’ this prince was pleased to say, that
<i>the laws were in his breath, and that he could make and unmake them at
his pleasure</i>, he did not think the time was come to put that vaunt in execution.
He took, therefore, another way of usurping the legislative power.
Having gained over a majority of the returning officers, and either intimidated
or gained over the most powerful of the nobility, he called the famous
parliament at Shrewsbury, after having nominated to the returning
officers whom they should return; and, as he expected, this parliament, if
so it may be called, was complaisant enough to compliment the king with
his heart’s desire. The former sentence against the judges was reversed,
and consequently the civil law set up as the standard in trials of treason.
And they indirectly transferred the whole legislative power to the sovereign
in the following manner.</p>

<p>As there had been many petitions left unanswered, and many motions
undecided, they gave the power of deciding these, or other matters that
might arise before the next parliament, to the king, twelve peers, and six
commoners. For this committee, they chose such persons, the majority of
whom were at the devotion of the king, and gave him and the majority
power to fill up vacancies; thereby rendering the calling any future parliament
absolutely unnecessary. Thus was the constitution subverted, and in
its stead set up an <i>oligarchy</i> in appearance, but in truth an absolute monarchy.
But as wisely and happily as Richard thought he had conduced this
affair, by which he supposed he had gained his long wished-for end, neither
the seeming authority of parliament, nor the anathemas thundered in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
pope’s bull against the contravenors, could satisfy the people that they were
not stripped of their ancient rights, or that the king and his committee were
rightful legislators. What sentiments the nation entertained appears, from
their deserting him as one man, and following the first standard that was set
up against him<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<p>Since the days of this unfortunate Richard, no king of England hath,
in open and express terms, assumed to himself singly the right of legislation.
Though James the First plainly claimed it, by implication, in many of his
speeches, particularly in those famous words of his, <i>that as it was blasphemy
for man to dispute what God might do in the plenitude of his omnipotence, so was
it sedition for subjects to dispute what a king might do in the fulness of his power</i>.
But it would be doing injustice to the house of Stuart not to acknowledge
that some of the princes before them, particularly the Tudors, tho’ they
did not pretend to make laws, yet issued out many proclamations, or <i>acts of
state</i>, as they were afterwards called, to which they exacted the same unlimited
obedience as if they had been laws enacted by parliament. This is a
point worthy consideration; for if all proclamations, or acts of the king and
his council, require unlimited obedience, it is to little purpose whether we
call them laws or not, since such they are in effect. But this, I think, will
be pretty plain, if we make a proper distinction between such proclamations,
or acts of the king, as are particular exertions of the executive power,
which the law and constitution hath entrusted him with, and such as, affecting
the whole people, should in any wise alter, diminish, or impair the rights
they were before lawfully in possession of.</p>

<p>To give some few instances of the first sort. The appointment of magistrates,
the proclaiming war or peace, the laying on embargoes, or performance
of quarantine, the ordering erection of beacons in times of danger of
an invasion, the granting of escheated or forfeited estates, and many more,
are the antient and undoubted prerogatives of the king alone, and the subject
who resists, or disobeys, in such cases, is as much a <i>rebel</i>, or disobedient
subject, as if these acts were exercised by the whole legislature. But
with respect to making general rules and ordinances, affecting the previous
rights of the people, the case is very different. For if such were to be universally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
obeyed, it is equivalent to saying, that subjects have, properly
speaking, no rights at all, but hold every thing at the will of the king; a
speech which the most despotic monarch in Europe would not venture to
advance.</p>

<p>However, I will not carry this so far as to deny that there may cases
happen wherein the king may have this right, and wherein his proclamations
and orders, even relating to such points, ought to be obeyed. The
cases, I mean, are those of a foreign invasion, or intestine rebellion, when
the danger is too imminent to attend the resolutions of parliament. In such
cases the constitution is, for a time, suspended by external violence, and as
<i>salus populi suprema lex est</i>, every man is under an obligation to use his utmost
endeavours to restore it, and, consequently, obliged to obey him, to
whom the constitution has particularly entrusted that care. Instances of this
kind did happen during the confusions raised by the houses of York and
Lancaster, and the princes were accordingly obeyed. These precedents
doubtless gave a handle to their successors, who had no competitors to the
throne, to exercise the same power in more settled times. But this was
used, at first, in a cautious and sparing manner; and Henry the Eighth,
who was a monarch as unlikely to make undue condescensions to his people
as ever lived, was glad to derive it from the grant of parliament, that his
proclamations should have the force of laws, which was, in truth, giving
into his hands the legislative power for life<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.</p>

<p>His great successor, Elizabeth, carried this practice farther, and it will
be worth while to discover the reason why a people, in antient times, so
jealous of their privileges, should to the one prince explicitly give up, and
quietly suffer the other to usurp this power, so essential to a limited constitution.
And the cause I take to be the critical state the nation stood in with
respect to religion. The bulk of the people, glad to be delivered from the
yoke of papal tyranny, and dreading its restoration, were willing to arm
their princes with a power sufficient to protect their religion from foreign
and domestic enemies; and about religion indeed, this power was at first
principally exercised, on the footing of the papal supremacy being transferred
to the king. Their end was attained: Papists and Puritans were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
both kept under, and happy in the enjoyment of their religion, they did not
consider the consequences; that this very weapon might be used, by a
prince of another stamp, to root out the very religion they were so fond of,
and that, by admitting this exertion of power in a matter of so high consequence,
it would naturally be used in others that appeared of less<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>.</p>

<p>This was what accordingly happened. Proclamations on other points
were issued; and monopolies in trade were introduced. All monopolies, undoubtedly,
were not destructive to trade. Where a new traffick has been
discovered, and one that requires a large expence, and is liable to many
hazards, it is very reasonable that the first undertakers should have the
trade for a time confined to them, that, by the prospect of extraordinary
profit, they may be encouraged to promote and settle that commerce on a
solid bottom. Such monopolies, instead of hurting, tend to the promotion
of traffick, and are not without similar instances in former times, I mean
the kings of England appointing the towns for the staple; and had Elizabeth
and James confined themselves to the erection of the Russia, the Turky,
and East India companies, and that for a limited term, their conduct would
have deserved the highest applause; but that was far from being the case.
Monopolies were introduced in the antient, the most common and most
necessary commodities, to the great impoverishment of the nation by the
advance of prices.</p>

<p>At first it may seem strange that the wise Elizabeth, who, on all occasions,
seemed to have her people’s wealth and ease at heart, should follow
so destructive a course. But the great end of all her actions was the securing
herself on the throne, and one of the principal means she used for that
end, was the asking money from her people as seldom as possible. Hence
proceeded the long leases of the crown lands, at small rents and large fines,
and hence all the monopolies, which she sold to the undertakers; but better
had it been for her subjects, to have raised the sums she wanted by an additional
subsidy, or an easy tax, than to pay to the monopolists what they had
advanced, with their exorbitant profits besides. What Elizabeth began out
of policy, James continued, to supply his profusion, to such an extraordinary
degree, as disgusted his people, provoked his parliament, and at last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
made himself ashamed, insomuch that he revoked above twenty. And now
no monopoly can be raised but by act of parliament, except in case of a new
invention, and that but for a short term of years<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>.</p>

<p>I come now to the <i>dispensing power</i>, another prerogative which the Stuarts
claimed, and which cost the last of them the throne. As no state can
subsist without mercy as well as justice, the king hath the power of distributing
this mercy, and exempting a convicted criminal from the penalty of
the law, but this is only where the conviction is at his suit; thus the king
can pardon a murderer convicted on an indictment in the king’s name, but
if he was convicted on an <i>appeal</i> by the next relation, the king cannot. The
pardon belongs to the appellant. But there is a wide difference between a
<i>pardon</i>, that is remission of punishment after the fact, and <i>dispensing</i>, which
is giving a previous licence to break the law. A general dispensation is, in
fact, a repeal, and a particular one is a repeal <i>quod hunc</i>, and therefore can
belong only to the legislature. The Roman emperors, and the popes, as
legislators, assumed this power, and Henry the Third, an apt pupil of his
lord and master the pope, introduced the practice into England. In his
reign a patent, with a <i>non obstante</i> to any law whatsoever, was produced
into court before Roger de Thurkeby, and this honest judge was astonished
at the innovation, as Matthew Paris tells us in these words: <i>Quod cum comperisset,
ab alto ducens suspicia de prædictæ adjectionis appositione, dixit, heu,
heu hos utquid dies expectavimus, ecce, jam civilis curia exemplo ecclesiasticæ,
conquinatur, &amp; a sulphureo fonte rivulus intoxicatur</i><a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Lords of Parliament or Peers—Earls and Barons—The earlier state of Baronies
in England—The Barones majores &amp; minores—Barons by writ and by letters
patent—The different ranks of Nobility.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Next in rank to the king are the <i>lords</i>, that held immediately of
him by military service, as long as that species of tenure subsisted;
and whom, from their privilege of sitting in parliament in their own rights,
are frequently called <i>Lords of Parliament</i>, and in common speech are called
<i>Peers</i>, though that word properly signifies any <i>co-vassals</i> to the same lord.
Thus every immediate vassal of a baron are peers of that barony, and the
accurate description of the great personages I am speaking of is <i>Pares Regni</i>.
Of these there were, antiently, two ranks only, in England, <i>Earls</i> and
<i>Barons</i>. Indeed, abroad also, to speak properly, there were but two likewise:
for there was no difference in power and privilege between the <i>dukes</i>
and <i>counts</i>, or <i>earls</i>. But as every earl is a baron, and something more, and
as it is a maxim of our law, that every lord of parliament sits there by virtue
of his barony, it will, in the first place, be necessary to see what a
baron is.</p>

<p>The word <i>baron</i> of itself originally, did not, more than peer, signify an
immediate vassal of the king; for earls palatine had their barons, that is,
their immediate tenants; and, in old records, the citizens of London are
stiled barons, and so are the representatives of the cinque ports called to
this day. Baron, therefore, at first signified only the immediate tenant of
that superior whose baron he is said to be, but by length of time it became
restrained to those who, properly and exactly speaking, were <i>barones regis
&amp; regni</i>, and even not to all of these, but to such only as had manors and
courts therein. For though, by the principles of the feudal constitutions,
every immediate military tenant of the crown, however small his holding,
was obliged to assist the king with his advice, and entitled likewise to give
or refuse his assent to any new law or subsidy, that is, to attend in parliament.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
This attendance was too heavy and burthensome upon such as had
only one or two knights fees, and could not be complied with without their
ruin. Hence arose the omission of issuing writs to such, and which, being
for their ease, they acquiesced in, attendance in parliament being considered
at that time as a burthen. Thus they lost that right they were entitled to
by the nature of their tenure, until the method was found out of admitting
them by representation. Hence arose the distinction between <i>tenants by
barony</i>, and <i>tenants by knight service in capite</i> of the king. The former
were such military tenants of the king, as had estates so considerable as qualified
them, without inconvenience, to attend in parliament, and who were
therefore entitled to be summoned. The <i>quantum</i> of this estate was regularly
thirteen knights fees and one third, as that of a count or earl was
twenty; that is, as a knight’s fee was then reckoned at twenty pounds <i>per
annum</i>, the baron’s revenue was four hundred marks, or two hundred sixty-six
pounds thirteen shilling and four-pence, and the earl’s four hundred
pounds, answering in value of money at present to about two thousand six
hundred, and four thousand pounds yearly<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of all the baronies of England for about two hundred
years after the conquest; and they are called <i>baronies by tenure</i>, because
the dignity and privileges were annexed to the lands they held; and
if these were alienated with the consent of the king (for without that they
could not) the barony went over to the alienée. The manner of creating
these barons was by investiture, that is, by arraying them with a robe of state,
and a cap of honour, and girding on a sword, as the symbols of their dignity.
Of these Matthew Paris tells us there were two hundred and fifty in
the time of Henry the Third, and while they stood purely on this footing, it
was not in the king’s power to encrease the number of the baronies, though
of barons perhaps he might. For as William the Conqueror was obliged to
gratify several of his great officers according to the number of men they
brought, with two or more baronies, whenever these fell into the hands of
the crown by escheat, either for want of heirs, or by forfeiture, it was in
the king’s power, and was his interest, to divide them into separate hands.
The same thing likewise happened, when, by an intermarriage with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
heiress, more baronies than one came into the hands of a nobleman, and
escheated to the crown<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.</p>

<p>But the number of these feudal baronies could not, strictly or properly
speaking, be encreased by the king; for they could be created only out of
lands, and there were no lands vacant to create new ones out of, for the
king’s demesnes were, in those days, unalienable. However, we find, at
the end of Henry the Third’s reign, and even in John’s, that the number of
baronies were actually encreased, and a distinction made between the <i>barones
majores</i>, and <i>minores</i>. The <i>majores</i> were those who stood upon the old
footing of William, and had lands sufficient in law, namely, the number of
knights fees requisite. The <i>minores</i> were such as held by part of a barony;
as when an old barony descended to, and was divided among sisters; in
which case, when the husband of the sister whom the king pleased to name,
was the baron of parliament; or else were newly carved out of the old baronies
that had fallen in by escheat; as supposing the king had granted six
knights fees of an old barony to one, to hold with all the burthens, and to
do the service of an entire barony, and the remaining seven and one third to
another, on the same terms. But the attendance of these minor barons also,
at length became too burthensom for their circumstances, and many of
them were glad to be excused. The kings took then the power of passing
by such as they thought unable, by not sending them writs of summons,
and John extended his prerogative even to omit summoning such of the
<i>majores</i> as he imagined were inclined to oppose him. This however at
length he was obliged to give up: For in his Magna Charta it is said, <i>Ad
habendum commune consilium regni faciemus summoneri archiepiscopos, episcopos,
abbates, commites, &amp; majores barones regni sigillatim, per literas nostras</i><a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>barones majores</i> were then fully and plainly distinguished from the
<i>minores</i>, and I think it will not be doubted they were such as had the full
complement of knights fees that made up an antient barony; and, accordingly,
we find in 1255, when Henry the Third had neglected summoning
some of these, the others refused to enter on any business, <i>Quia omnes,
tunc temporis, non fuerunt, juxta tenorem Magnæ Chartæ suæ, vocati, et ideo,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
sine paribus suis, tunc absentibus, nullum voluerunt tunc responsum dare, vel auxilium
concedere vel prestare</i>. No king since, ever omitted to summon all the
greater nobility, until Charles the First was prevailed upon to forbid the
sending a writ to the Earl of Bristol by Buckingham, who was afraid of being
accused by that nobleman; but on the application of the house of lords,
and their adjourning themselves from day to day, and doing no business,
the writ at last was issued.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry the Third also, the king’s prerogative of summoning
or omitting the lesser barons was likewise ascertained by an act of parliament
since lost, as we find by these words from history: <i>Ille enim rex
(scilicet Henricus Tertius) post magnas perturbationes, &amp; enormes vexationes
inter ipsum regem, Simonem de Morteforti, &amp; alios barones, motas &amp; sopitas, statuit
&amp; ordinavit, quod omnes illi commites &amp; barones regni Angliæ, quibus ipse
rex dignatus est brevia summonitionis dirigere, venirent ad parlamentum suum;
&amp; non alii nisi, forte, dominus rex alia illa brevia illis dirigere voluisset</i><a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. And
from henceforth no nobleman could sit in parliament without a writ. But
there was this difference between the greater and the lesser barons, that the
former had a right to their writ <i>ex debito justitiæ</i>, to the latter it was a matter
of favour; but when summoned, they, being really barons, had the same
rights with the rest, though sitting, not by any inherent title, but by virtue
of the writ. The other lesser barons, who were generally omitted to be
summoned, by degrees mixed with the other kings tenants in capite, and
were thenceforth represented by the knights of the shires<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.</p>

<p>But these baronies by tenure being long since worn out among the laity,
it is proper to proceed to the two ways now in being of creating peers, by
<i>writ</i>, and by <i>letters patent</i>. It is the lord Coke’s opinion, and in this he
has been followed ever since, that a writ to any man, baron, or no baron,
to sit in parliament, if once he hath taken his seat in pursuance thereof,
gains a barony to him and the heirs of his body. And though the law,
principally on the authority of that great lawyer, is now so settled, certainly
it is comparatively but a novel opinion, and very ill to be supported by reason.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
The words of the writ are, <i>Rex tali salutem, quia de advisamento &amp;
assensu concilii nostri, pro quibusdam arduis &amp; urgentibus negotiis statum &amp; defensionem
regni nostri Angliæ contingentibus, quoddam parlamentum nostrum apud
Westmonast. tali die, talis mensis, proximo futuro teneri ordinavimus, &amp; ibidem
vobiscum, ac cum prelatis magnatibus &amp; proceribus dicti regni nostri, colloquium
habere &amp; tractatum; vobis in fide &amp; ligeantia quibus nobis tenemini, firmiter
injungendo mandamus, quod consideratis dictorum negotiorum auctoritate &amp; periculis
imminentibus, cessante excusatione quacunque, dictis die &amp; loco personaliter
intersitis nobiscum, ac cum prelatis magnatibus &amp; proceribus super dictis negotiis
tractaturi, vestrumque consilium impensuri, &amp; hoc sicut nos, &amp; honorem nostrum,
ac expeditionem negotiorum prædictorum diligitis, nullatenus omittatis</i><a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.</p>

<p>That this writ must be obeyed, there is no doubt, for every subject is, by
his allegiance, obliged to assist the king with faithful counsel: But what
right the party summoned acquired thereby is the question. The words are
not only personal to him, but restricted likewise to a particular place and
time; and accordingly, in antient times, we find many persons summoned
to one parliament, omitted in the next, and summoned perhaps to the third.
There is not a word therein that hints at giving the least right to an heir;
and what reason can be assigned why a man, by this writ, should gain an estate
of inheritance in a peerage, when, in letters patents, it is admitted that he
gains only an estate for life, without the word <i>heirs</i>. That antiently there
was no such notion appears from the summons to parliament, where frequently
we find the grandfather summoned, the father passed by, and the
grandson afterwards summoned: Nay, in the rolls there are instances of
ninety-eight persons being summoned a single time only, and neither themselves,
nor any of their posterity, ever taken notice of afterwards. Or, if
we were to allow that this writ created an inheritance, what reason can be
given why it should be an estate tail only, and be confined to the heirs of
the body, and not, as all other new inheritances, created generally, go to
the collateral heirs?</p>

<p>But, in order to discover plainly what privileges persons so called by
writ, had, or could obtain in those times, it will be proper to distinguish
them into three kinds of persons. First, then, they were either some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
<i>minores barones by tenure</i>; and these, when called, had certainly all the privileges
of the greater; or else they were not barons at all, but plain knights
or gentlemen; and, with respect to these, it is plain they had a right to
deliberate, debate, and advise. But the better opinion is, they had no right
to vote, but were assistants and advisers only, as the judges are at present;
for it is absurd to suppose that, in those times, when the commons were
low, and inconsiderable, and the barons were more powerful than the crown,
these latter should suffer their resolutions to be over-ruled at the pleasure of
the king, by his calling in such numbers as we find he often did, which
must have been the case, if all he summoned had votes. But these two
kinds of persons gained by their writ, or sitting in consequence of it, originally,
no farther right than to be present at that time. However, by many
of these persons and their heirs having been constantly summoned, especially
since Henry the Seventh’s reign, and the ancient practice of omitting any
who had been very frequently so, going into disuse, the distinction between
the greater and the lesser barons was forgot, and that opinion prevailed
which my lord Coke had adopted, and which is now the law, that a man,
having once sat in parliament in pursuance of the king’s writ, acquires thereby
an estate tail to him and the heirs of his body<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.</p>

<p>There were yet another kind of persons, not peers, that might be summoned
by writ. These were the eldest sons of peers, to whom the father’s
barony must descend; and in such case, if the heir was called by the name
of a barony that was in his father, he was a baron to all intents and purposes.
But it seems very plain, that this was not a new creation of a barony; for in
that case the son so called should have been the lowest peer, whereas the practice
is the contrary. The eldest son of the duke of Norfolk, called by the
title of lord Mowbray, sat first baron, because that barony of his father’s is
the antientest in England. It seems, therefore, that this was considered as a
transfer of the antient barony by the joint consent of the father and king, and
the father still continues to sit by the remaining peerage in him. Accordingly
we find no instance of a baron’s son sitting on such a summons, unless the
father had another barony by which he might sit. If the father indeed had a
higher title, that has been reckoned sufficient to support his seat, though his
only barony was transferred to the son. This then being no new creation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
but a temporary transfer only of an old peerage, it should seem, that this
title, when once merged in the greater by the father’s death, should go according
to the old limitation; but of late we find them considered as new
creations. On the death of the late earl of Derby, Sir Edward Stanley, his
sixth cousin, succeeded, and sits in parliament as baron Strange, by Henry
the Seventh’s creation; but an elder son of a former earl of Derby, having
been called by writ while his father was living, the Duke of Athol, as his
heir by the female line, sits by the same title of baron Strange of king
Charles the First’s creation.</p>

<p>The descent of these two kinds of baronies are directed by the rules of
the descent of other inheritances at common law, and consequently females
are capable of succession, but with two exceptions; first, that half blood is
no impediment, and consequently the half brother excludes the sister; secondly,
that the honour is not divisible, and therefore, if there be two or
more sisters, heiresses, the title is <i>in abeyance</i>, that is, is suspended, until
the king makes choice of one of them and her heirs; though by constant
usage the law seems to be verging fast to a constant descent to the eldest<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>.</p>

<p>The third method of creating peers is by <i>letters patent</i>, which is the most
usual, and esteemed the most advantageous way; because a peerage is
thereby created, though the new nobleman hath never taken his seat, which
is not the case of a barony by writ. As to the manner of these creations,
there has a notable difference intervened since the accession of Henry the
Seventh from what was the practice before Richard the Second. In his
eleventh year began this method of creating by patent, in favour of John
de Beauchamp, who, though summoned, never sat there, but was attainted
by the next parliament, and afterwards executed. But, the attainder out
of the case, his patent in law could never have been deemed valid, because
Michael de la Pole was the lord chancellor who affixed the seal to it, which
had been before taken from him by act of parliament, and he declared incapable
of ever having it again. This, then, was a single and ineffectual
attempt of that weak prince to create a new peer without the assent of parliament,
which was the usual way, above thirty having been made so in
that very reign. His successors were too wise to follow this example; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
every barony newly created, till the union of the roses, which were about
fourteen, were, every one of them, as appears on the face of the patents,
by authority of parliament, if we except two or three; and even these, on
a close examination, will appear not to be new baronies, but <i>regrants</i> of old
feudal baronies by tenure, which, undoubtedly, were all in the sole disposition
of the king<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<p>But Henry the Seventh, having trodden down all opposition, was fortunate
enough to carry the point Richard had vainly attempted, and acquired
for his successors that prerogative which they have since enjoyed, of creating
peers at pleasure. The descent of these titles, created by patent, is directed
by the words of the creation. If heirs are not mentioned, it is only an
estate for life; if to a man and heirs of his body, females are not excluded,
but the general way is, to the heirs male of the body of the grantée, perhaps,
with remainders over, and they descend as other estates entailed.
The case of the dutchy of Somerset was singular. Edward Seymour having
sons by two venters, was created duke of Somerset, and his heirs male of
his second marriage, remainder to his heirs male by his first. This title
continued near two hundred years in the younger branch, until, upon its
failure in the late duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, the present
duke, the heir by the prior marriage, succeeded by virtue of the remainder.</p>

<p>In the case of lord Purbeck, in Charles the Second’s reign, it was controverted
whether a title could be extinguished, for as lord Purbeck had
surrendered his honour by fine to the king, and there it was determined,
and so the law now stands, contrary to many precedents that were produced,
that the title is inherent in the blood, and while that remains uncorrupted,
can by no means be extinguished by surrender or otherwise, and this, generally,
whether the peerage be created by patent or by writ; for Purbeck’s
was by writ. In case of a patent where the dignity is expressly entailed, it
is surely as reasonable that it should be impossible for the possessor to destroy
the entail, as in an estate tail of land, created by the king, and yet in old
times there had been many instances to the contrary. I shall mention but
two that happened in this kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Butler was created baron Cahir by Henry the Eighth to his
heirs general. His heirs male failed in his son Edmond, the second baron,
and his nephew, Sir Theobald, was, in 1683, by queen Elizabeth created
baron Cahir; but it being found that Sir Thomas left daughters, to one of
whom the title ought to have been assigned by the queen, one of them, and
the heir of the other, who was dead in 1685, bargained, sold, and released
to Sir Theobald and his assigns, their right and title to the said honour. The
other was the case of the honour of Kingsale. Charles the First, apprehending
the barony of Kingsale to be extinguished by attainder, created
Sir Dominick Sarsfield viscount Kingsale, but, upon lord Kingsale’s petition,
and proof made by him that his barony still subsisted, it was ordered
that Sarsfield should surrender his viscounty of Kingsale, and be treated viscount
of Kilmallock, with his former precedence, which was accordingly
done.</p>

<p>These two instances were, indeed, of a particular nature, and calculated
to rectify grants that had arisen from error; but in England there were, in
ancient times, many instances of such surrenders without error. They were,
indeed, generally made in order to obtain higher titles; and therefore it is
no wonder they passed <i>sub silentio</i>, and were never disputed. But as to the
old baronies by tenure that were annexed to land, nothing is clearer than
that, by the king’s consent, they might be aliened or surrendered, notable
instances of which happened in the reign of Henry the Third. Andrew
Giffard, baron of Pomfret, surrendered to the king; and Simon de Montfort,
a nobleman of large possessions in France, had two sons by the heiress
of the earldom of Leicester, in whose right he was earl of Leicester, and,
having a mind to settle his second son in England, assigned the earldom over
to him, as Selden says; or, which comes to the same thing (for the eldest
son was equally defeated) surrendered it to the king, who granted it to the
second, according to Camden.</p>

<p>All noblemen are equally so, and, therefore, each others peers; but
they differ in rank and precedence. The ranks are five; <i>dukes</i>, <i>marquisses</i>,
<i>earls</i>, <i>viscounts</i>, <i>barons</i>. The first duke was created by Edward the Third;
the first marquiss, by Richard II.; the first viscount, by Henry the Sixth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Though their dignities are now personal, and annexed to the blood, yet as
they were originally annexed to land, so much of the old form remains, that,
in their creation, they must be named from some place in some county;
though I do not apprehend it to be material at this day, whether there really
be such a place or not. With respect to the raising a lord from a lower degree
of dignity to a higher, I should observe, that long before Henry the
Seventh’s time, the king had the right solely in himself, though it was frequently
done in parliament; for this was not adding to the number of the
peers, but an exertion of the ancient prerogative of his settling precedence
according to his pleasure. This continued in England till Henry the Eighth,
by act of parliament, settled it according to antiency, and it still continues
in Ireland, though it has not been exerted since Henry the Seventh’s time,
when lord Kingsale, a Yorkist, was obliged to change places with lord
Athenry, a Lancastrian, and from first became the second baron, which
hath continued his rank, till lately, that Athenry was created an earl<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Earls or Counts as distinguished from Barons—The office of Counts—Their condition
after the conquest—Counties Palatine in England—Counties Palatine in
Ireland—Spiritual Peers—The trials of Noblemen.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In my last lecture I treated of baronies, which are the lowest rank of
peerage, and of the right whereby this class of nobles sits in the great
council of the nation, and also of the various methods that have prevailed
in different ages of creating them; but before I have done with the higher
nobility, it will be necessary to say something of <i>earls</i> or <i>counts</i> as distinguished
from barons; for they differ from them, not only in having a
greater number of knights fees, and consequently having a greater revenue,
but in possessing also a more extensive jurisdiction. The institution of
<i>counts</i>, I observed in a former lecture, wherein I treated of the progress of
the feudal law, was not, originally, a part of the feudal policy. They
were, indeed, always chosen out of the king’s companions, who resided in
his house, and were therefore called <i>comites</i>, but they were not set to preside
over Germans, who were the conquerors, but over such of the old inhabitants,
Romans or Gauls, who by a voluntary submission had retained
their freedom, and who in every respect, except bearing a share in the legislature
or government, were on an equal footing with the conquerors<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</p>

<p>The office of these counts was threefold, to judge these freemen in peace,
to conduct them in war, to manage the king’s demesnes in their respective
districts, and to account with him for them and the profits of his courts of
justice; which were very considerable when all offences were punished by
fines. At the beginning they were temporary officers, but they soon became
fixed for life, and at length, towards the latter end of the second, and in
the beginning of the third race in France, they got, through the weakness
of the crown, estates in fee in their counties; and either by grants of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
kings, or by usurpation, converted the profits they before accounted for to
the crown, for their own use, and held their courts in their own name. In
short, they became petty sovereigns, paying only homage, and the usual
services of ward, marriage, and relief to their supreme lord; and as such
they coined money, levied war against their neighbours, nay frequently
against the king himself; until Lewis the Eleventh found the means of
humbling them, and brought the crown out of tutelage, as the French
express it<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p>The present state of Germany is an exact representation of what the
French and the other continental monarchies were in those days, except that
the kings had large countries, and multitudes of vassals immediately subject
to them; whereas the emperor hath now none. But in England these lords,
tho’ very powerful, never ascended to such a pinnacle of grandeur. Their
first constitution here we must refer to the time of the division of England
into counties, to which they had a reference, which is generally ascribed to
Alfred. Their power and office was exactly the same with the counts on
the continent in those early times, namely, to judge and lead the freemen to
war. For the greatest part of the lands of England were at that time allodial,
as is proved by Spelman, contrary to the opinion of Sir Edward Coke;
although, with him, it must be allowed, that there were fiefs also before
the Conquest, and that they were not all introduced at that period. Till
that time their office was only for life, and they were known by various
names, as <i>duces</i>, <i>comites</i>, and <i>consules</i> in Latin, <i>ealdermen</i> in Saxon, and <i>earls</i>
in the Danish tongue<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.</p>

<p>But William, having turned all the lands into feudal, was obliged to
put his earls on the same footing, that those on the continent were in his
time, and consequently to make them hereditary. However he and his
successors were careful not to give them such extensive powers and revenues
as they had abroad. The county courts were held in the king’s name, neither
were the earls allowed the whole profits of them, two-thirds of them
being reserved to the king; and in appearance to ease them, who were often
obliged to attend in council or in war, but in reality to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
king’s being defrauded, and to prevent the too great influence which their
judging in person might acquire to them in their districts, officers chosen by
the people, and approved by the king, were substituted to administer justice
under the names of <i>vice comites</i>, or sheriffs; these were to pay to the
king the two-thirds, and to the earl his third of the profits, which was in
those times looked upon as so incident to an earldom, as to pass with it,
although express words were wanting; so that in those times an earl and a
county were correlatives<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>Each earl took his title from some one county, and the number of the
one could not exceed that of the other. King John, however, altered their
nature in some measure, and his example has been followed in depriving
the earl of the thirds of the county profits; for he created Henry de Bohun
earl of Hereford, and granted to him twenty pounds yearly, to be received
out of the third penny of the county in lieu thereof. But it is plain
that the justice and success of this invention was doubted of at first, for John
took a collateral security from the earl, that he should never in his earldom
claim any more than the twenty pounds expressly granted him. These
sums, so granted, are called <i>creation money</i>, and were formerly expressly
granted out of the third penny of the county; but of late have been made
payable at the Exchequer. Such was the nature of the ancient earldoms
that were by tenure, and had reference to counties. The modern ones,
that are merely honorary, and go with the blood, were first made in parliament.
Afterwards the king was allowed, by his sole authority, to advance
a baron to a higher rank; for that was not adding to the number of the
peers; but the creation of a bare gentleman a peer at once hath only been
practised since the accession of Henry the Seventh<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

<p>Before I quit this head of earldoms, it will be proper to say somewhat
about <i>counties palatine</i> which had extraordinary privileges, like unto the
counties and duchies abroad. The first was that of Chester, erected by the
Conqueror, in favour of his nephew Hugh Lupus, in these words: <i>Totumque
hunc comitatum tenendum sibi &amp; hæredibus, ita libere ad gladium, sicut ipse
rex tenet Angliam ad coronam</i>. The effect of this creation was to have <i>jura<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
regalia</i>; for the earl palatine might pardon treason, murder, and other offences,
might make justices of assize, gaol delivery, and of the peace;
might create barons of his county palatine, and confer knighthood. They
had likewise all forfeitures, that arose by the common law, or by any prior
statute; but forfeitures arising from statute, made after the erection of the
county palatine, belonged to the king. They had courts as the king had
at Westminster, and out of their chancery issued all writs, original and judicial.
Neither did the king’s writs run within the county palatine, except
writs of error, which were in the nature of appeals, or in cases where, otherwise,
there would be a failure of justice. All manner of indictments and
processes were made in the name, and every trespass was laid to be done
against the peace of him that had the county palatine. But these and some
other privileges have been taken away, and annexed to the crown, in whose
name they must now be; but the <i>teste</i> of the writs is still in the name of the
earl palatine<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>Of these counties palatine there are now in England four, Lancaster united
to the crown, Chester to the principality of Wales; Durham and Ely,
each belonging to the bishop of the place; but the privileges of these two
are going fast into disuse. But in this kingdom, (Ireland) for the encouragement
of adventurers, the whole country, as fast as it could be reduced, was
erected into palatinates, and very little, except the cities, retained in the
king’s hand. The making so many great lords, who had frequent quarrels
with each other, and that at such a distance from the seat of government,
was one great occasion of the slowness of the settlement of the kingdom.
For, to strengthen themselves, such of them as resided here attached the natives
to them, and taught them the use of arms, and others that dwelt in
England entirely neglected to send hither any defence, so that, by the end
of Edward the Third’s time, the Irish had repossessed themselves of almost
the whole kingdom, if we except five or six counties; whereas in John’s
reign they held not above half, and that under homage and tribute, either
to the king, or the lords, who had grants from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>I shall give a short detail of these palatinates, and an account of the
manner of their distinguishment. The present county of Gallway, under the
name of the county of Cannaught, was a palatinate in the De Burghs; as
was Ulster, first in De Courcy, then in De Lacy; and these two were united
by De Burgh’s marriage with Lacy’s daughter, and afterwards descended
to Lionel of Clarence’s daughter, who married the earl of March, and, in
the person of Edward the Fourth, merged in the crown. In the same prince,
likewise, merged that of Meath, which, being in another branch of the Lacy’s,
was divided into the eastern and western between two daughters.
The former came by descent to the house of March, and so to Edward the
Fourth. Strongbow had the grant of Leinster as a Palatinate, which at
length was divided into five distinct ones between his grand-daughters, who
being married to English noblemen, took no care for the defence of the
country, their titles, estates, and Jura Regalia were taken from them by act
of parliament, under Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>Kildare, being in the hands of the earl of that name, escaped for a little
time, until he was attainted under the same king, where it ended; for
though his heir was restored to the title and estate by queen Mary, it was
with an express exception of the palatinate. The kingdom of Cork, containing
that county and the south of Kerry, was another palatinate, granted to
Fitz Stephen and Cogan, who made partition between them; and on Fitz
Stephen’s death without issue, his part escheated to the crown. Cogan’s
share should have gone to the Courcey’s and Carens, but they could never obtain
the possession of it; for the earl of Desmond got the estate by purchase
from a Cogan who pretended a right, and held it; so this share of the palatinate
fell likewise into disuse. Desmond, indeed, had interest enough to get
a new palatinate created for himself in the county of Kerry, called Desmond,
which for repeated rebellions was justly forefeited to queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Edward the Third erected the palatinate of Tipperary in favour of the
earl of Ormond, who was grandson to Edward the First, which continued
in that family, with some interruptions, until the attainder of the late duke
in 1715. Thus by degrees the crown regained the power it had parted with,
and was at length enabled, though with difficulty, to reduce the whole kingdom,
which had been well nigh lost by means of such profuse grants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>Besides the temporal peers, there are spiritual ones, that is the bishops,
and, they have seats in parliament, which antiently many abbots also enjoyed.
The original of this right was from the feudal customs. The priests of the
Germans, while they continued pagans, were necessary attendants in their
general assemblies, not only for advice, but the benefit of their prayers and
divinations. When these nations embraced Christianity, they transferred
the same veneration and honour to their new instructors and bishops; and
sometimes other churchmen of eminence, though they held lands not by
military tenure, but by what is called <i>free alms</i>, were, in every nation as well
as England, members of the states of parliaments. But since the conquest
they have begun to sit by another right, namely by their baronies; the conqueror
having converted their estates in free alms into baronies, and to
their great mortification, subjected them to military service<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

<p>Upon this head several questions have been propounded, as how far
they are lords of parliament, and whether the clergy are a third estate of the
realm, and sit solely in that right. This is a question of some importance,
because if they make a distinct estate, no law would be good to which the
majority of them did not consent. Certain it is that in France, the clergy
made one estate, the nobility the second, the burghers the third; and in
Sweden the peasants make the fourth, all sitting in distinct houses, the majority
of each of which must concur. And therefore I do believe, that
when, in England, we talk of <i>three estates</i>, the clergy, not the bishops alone,
make one of them, contrary to the modern opinion, that the king is the
first estate, and the bishops and the nobility the second; for the king is in
no country reckoned one of the estates, but the head of all. However
from this no argument can be drawn that the bishops should sit separately,
or that a majority of them, as representing the clergy, should concur.</p>

<p>As to sitting separately, it is pretty clear that, by the old law, none were
members of parliament, but the immediate military tenants of the king, and
that they sat all in one house, however their titles and fortune might differ;
being all equal as to rank, with respect to the king, and all having the same
rights. The division of parliament into two houses was never known in Scotland,
who, in all probability, modelled their constitution from their neighbours;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
nor doth it appear in England previous to Edward the First, but
arose, probably, from the great barons disdaining to sit, as equals with citizens
and burgesses. For even, after this time, they did not disdain to associate
with the knights of the shires, who represented the minor barons, and
other military tenants, as appears by many instances. But for a number of
centuries past the gentry, which were formerly considered as a lower noblesse,
and are so abroad, have been melted into one body with the other
commoners<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.</p>

<p>If then there was originally but one house, and if, since the division, the
bishops have constantly sat in the house of peers, there can be no pretence
for any privilege for them more than for the body of barons or earls. It is
urged, likewise, that several valid acts of parliament were passed without
any bishop present; but this happened only in distracted times; and, whoever
might think it prudent or proper to absent themselves at a particular
season, it will hardly be said to be a good parliament when they were not
summoned; and if, at any time, they refused to attend, there was no reason
why the public business should stop, as they sat, not as an independent
constituent part of parliament, but each distinctly for himself, in right of his
barony. From these occasional and general absences of theirs, an opinion
grew up by degrees, and now is established law, that there is a material difference
between bishops and lay lords, in respect to their nobility. In truth,
that they are not peers to each other, and consequently that a bishop cannot
sit in judgment on the life of a peer, neither is he to be tried by the
peers, but by a jury of commoners.</p>

<p>It is worth while to see how these opinions grew up; for, from the original
constitution, every bishop, being a baron by tenure, and having a fee
simple therein, had certainly as great right as other barons; but the canon
law having forbid any ecclesiastics being concerned in matters of blood, and
they being obliged by the common law to attend judgments in parliament,
were in a great streight between the two laws, how to act when a peer was
capitally accused. They at length obtained from Henry the Second in the
constitutions of Clarendon, the following allowance: <i>Et sicut cæteri barones
debent interesse judiciis curiæ, regis quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem membrorum,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
vel ad mortem</i>; where the last words are plainly an exception in
their favour, in derogation to the common law, on account of their peculiar
circumstances under the canon. However, as many questions might
arise before it came to the last vote, that might intirely influence the final
determination, they used to absent themselves totally, and this going on for
ages, and the feudal baronies wearing out, and all titles becoming fixed to
the blood, not to the land, they came to be considered as peers of a different
nature, because their blood did not succeed, and that which was first a favourable
permission, was construed a prohibition; and when this was once
established, it followed necessarily, that, not being peers to the nobility by
blood, they must be tried by commoners<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.</p>

<p>With respect to the trials of noblemen, now I have said so much on that
head, I shall observe, they were carried on in two different methods. Either
the accused person was tried in parliament, and then all the temporal
lords had voices, or he was tried by a jury of peers; that is the king appointed
twenty-four noblemen for that purpose: A law that has proved fatal to
many noblemen, who happened to fall under the displeasure of the court.
A commoner hath a right to prevent the sheriffs returning a jury to try him,
if he can shew a just exception to the sheriff; and after the return is made,
he can challenge a certain number for causes known only to himself, and as
many more as he can prove sufficient matter of exception to. Such care did
the law take of the lives of the commons, but no exception lay for a peer to
the king’s return. The law would not suppose the least partiality in him,
even in his own cause; neither would it suspect that a peer could be biassed
by any consideration from doing strict justice, and therefore no challenge
lay against him for any cause, however strong and notorious; and the same
confidence is the reason why they give their votes, guilty or not guilty, not
upon their oaths, but upon their honours.</p>

<p>I can scarce imagine that this method of trial could have prevailed in the
times of the great power of the barons, when they often made the crown to
totter; neither have I been able to discover its beginning. Certain it is
that, in the reigns of the Plantagenets most, if not all noblemen, were tried
in full parliament; and as certain it is, that, during the reigns of the Tudors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
and Stuarts, the other was universally followed; insomuch that every
nobleman was sure either to suffer or escape, according as the court was at
that time affected towards him. At length, after many struggles, about
1695, the bill for regulating trials for high treason and misprision of treason
was passed; one clause of which provides, that on the trial of peers, every
lord who hath a right to vote in parliament, shall be summoned, and have a
right to vote. Thus was the inconvenience attending the king’s naming
the jury remedied; but the law in the other point stands as before, that no
peer can be challenged. According to this law have all trials of Irish peers
proceeded since that time, though there is no act for that purpose in this
kingdom<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.</p>

<p><i>The share of the Commons in the Legislature—The Armigeri or Gentry—Knights
Bannerets—The nature of Knighthood altered in the reign of James I.—Knights
Baronets—Citizens and Burghers—The advancement of the power
and reputation of the Commons.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having given a general idea of the lords, and their share of the
legislature, it will now be proper to descend, and see the several
classes of the lower rank, called <i>Commons</i>, and to examine what share or
influence they had formerly, or now enjoy, in the government. The commoners
may, in general, then, be divided into the <i>lesser nobility</i>, or <i>gentry</i>,
and the others, whom, for distinction sake, I shall call the <i>lower commons</i>.
For although, since the reign of Henry the Eighth, many men of the best
families, and some descended from the nobility, have engaged in commerce,
and thereby brought lustre to that order of men, before that time all persons
engaged in trade were held in as much contempt by the gentry of
England, as they are at present, by those of any nation; and a gentleman
who employed himself in hunting, or perhaps serving the king, or some
great lord, was looked upon to have degraded himself.</p>

<p>The gentry were called <i>Armigeri</i>, because they fought on horseback, in
compleat armour, covered from head to foot; whereas the infantry’s defensive
arms were of a slighter kind, and no compleat covering. But we are
not to imagine that all who fought on horseback compleatly armed, were
gentry; for, in order to compleat their squadrons, men of the lower ranks,
who, by their strength of body, and military skill, were capable of service,
were admitted, but this did not make them gentlemen. Hence, in our old
histories, we find the <i>knights and esquires</i>, that is, the real gentry, carefully
distinguished from the <i>men at arms</i>. The peculiar privilege of the gentry
was the bearing on their shields certain marks, to distinguish them from
each other, and the men at arms called <i>Coats of Arms</i>. At first they were
personal privileges, and not inherent in the blood, and the marks and rewards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
of some personal act of bravery performed by the bearer; so we find
in the romances, that a new knight was to wear plain white, until, by some
exploit, he merited a mark. The general opinion is, that they were first
introduced at the time of the crusades, which I believe is pretty just, at
least with respect to our country: for the imperial crown of England had
no arms before the conquest. The Norman kings bore the arms of Normandy,
<i>two leopards passant</i>, to which Richard the First added that of
Guienne, another leopard passant, and so composed this English coat, in
which, among other alterations, the leopards have since been changed to
lions<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.</p>

<p>For the further encouragement of valour, these marks became transmissible
to heirs, not to the eldest son only, as lands, but to all the sons;
saving that the younger were to take some addition, for distinction sake.
While these coats were granted by the king alone, and that for real service
done, and consequently were not too common; and while the custom of
wearing compleat armour remained, and the office of high constable (the
judge in such matters) continued, the gentry were very curious in preserving
these distinctions, and vindicating them from usurpation. But as the
military disposition of our gentry hath greatly subsided since the loss of the
provinces in France, and the kings at arms have assumed the power of
giving coats, nicety in these respects hath long since expired; and now, as
in a commercial country, especially, it should be, education and behaviour
are sufficient criterions of a gentleman.</p>

<p>I shall therefore say no more of them, as distinguished from the rest of
the commonalty, but observe, that of these there are two ranks, <i>knights</i>
and <i>esquires</i>, or gentlemen. For though we now make a distinction between
these two last, the old law knew none, nor is it now a misnomer, in
a writ of pleadings, to stile an esquire a gentleman, or the contrary. The
holding of a knight’s fee did not make a man of that order, but there were
particular ceremonies required for the purpose. For the original design of
the institution of <i>dubbing knights</i>, was that, after a person had, by performing
military exercises, shewn that he had properly accomplished himself,
and was capable of that honourable service in the field, in his proper person,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
he should, by a public solemnity, be openly declared so. No wonder,
then, that the highest nobility, the sons of kings, nay kings themselves,
thought this title an addition to their dignity, as it was then an infallible
proof, that they had not degenerated from the virtue of their ancestors<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>.</p>

<p>But among knights there were some of a more distinguished kind (I do
not mean to speak of particular orders, such as those of the garter and
others) called <i>Bannerets</i>, as knights in general were made, upon their proving
themselves by exercises capable of service. These were never made
but for an actual exploit in war, and then were dubbed with great solemnity
under the royal banner. Their distinction was bearing a little banner, annexed
to the wooden part of their lance, adjoining the iron point; as, originally,
every man who had a whole knight’s fee, or the amount thereof in
parts of fees, was obliged to serve in person, and was not allowed a proxy,
but in cases of necessity every such person was obliged to appear upon the
king’s summons, to shew himself qualified, and to receive the order of
knighthood. This power continued in the king, even after the military tenants
were discharged of personal attendance on sending another, or paying
escuage, and came to be considered as a profitable fruit of the king’s
seignory, and was frequently used as an expedient to raise money, by obliging
the unqualified, or those who had no mind to the expence or fatigue of
attending, to compound<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.</p>

<p>This right of composition was established by act of parliament, the first
of Edward the Second, which likewise fixes the estate the persons summoned
must have at twenty pounds a year, the quantity of a knight’s fee;
twenty pounds a year was indeed the valuation of a knight’s fee at the time
of the conquest, but by change of times, in Edward the Second’s reign, it
may well be esteemed forty; so that by this act a man who had half a
knight’s fee was liable to be summoned. This was one of the unhappy
means made use of by king Charles the First to procure money when he
quarrelled with his parliament. He was sensible, indeed, of a difference in
the value of money, and therefore summoned none but such as had forty
pounds a-year; but had he paid due attention to its real rise, he should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
summoned none under an hundred and twenty. For in Edward’s reign a
pound in money was a real pound in silver, whereas in Charles’s, it was but
a third part, and so the proportion was to sixty pound sterling, and sixty
more is the least rise that can be allowed for the improvements in the value
of lands, by the intermediate increase of commerce. No wonder, therefore,
that his people looked upon it as an unsupportable grievance. Accordingly,
in the 17th of his reign, the act of Edward the second was repealed, and
in Ireland, it vanished with the tenures on which it depended<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p>The great change in the nature of knighthood happened in the reign of
James the First. The Plantagenets never created any persons such but with
a view to military merit, except their judges. The Tudors extended it to
persons who had served them well in civil stations, but so sparingly, and to
persons of such evident merit, that it still was an encouragement to those
that deserved well of the public. But James, who had a passion for creating
honours, poured forth his knighthoods, without regard to desert, with
so lavish an hand, confirming them for money frequently on wealthy traders,
and others without any apparent public merit, that thereby, as also
by creating an order of hereditary knights, called <i>baronets</i>, a knighthood
soon lost the badge of merit it before had carried.</p>

<p>The occasion of creating baronets was this. On the escheat of the six
counties in Ulster, they were planted with colonies of Scotch and English;
and, as it was necessary to support a standing army there, for some years
after, for the defence of the infant settlements, and money was wanting for
that purpose, as, in that reign, it always was for every other, this scheme
of creating an order of hereditary knights, to take place after the barons,
was fixed upon for that purpose. At first it had some aspect towards military
service, for each of them was obliged to maintain so many soldiers in
the plantation, for a limited time; and to make the honour more valuable,
and to get the better terms for it in the first plan, it was provided, that no
more than two hundred should be originally created; and when any of them
failed, no new ones to be created in their room. But it was soon seen that
these new knights, when they had once attained their dignities, might not
duly perform the services they engaged for. The maintaining the soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
therefore, was commuted into a sum paid to the king, who undertook to do
it; and had he been a good œconomist, it would have been a prudent precaution,
but whatever sums he could lay his hands on were always at the
mercy of his reigning favourite. He was, therefore, obliged to depart from
his intended limitation, and to exceed his number; and yet, after all, the
service was not done so well as it should have been. His successors have
followed his example, in adding to the number, which now is certainly unlimited<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<p>Next to the gentry, or military order, in estimation among the northern
nations stood the <i>citizens</i> and <i>burghers</i>, that is, the trading part of the nation,
whether merchants or artificers. These were for some ages held in a
very low light, none of the conquerors or their defendants applying themselves
to such occupations. They were, indeed, at first, allowed certain
privileges and enjoyed their own laws, under the inspection of magistrates
appointed by the king, known by the name of <i>Præpositi</i>, <i>Provosts</i>, or some
other equivalent title. But these liberties did not last long. The turbulent
temper of the times, the frequent competitions for the throne, and the many
rebellions of the great lords, occasioned the towns and their inhabitants to
be taken in war, one after another; and the persons so taken, were, by the
prevailing <i>Jus Gentium</i> of these ages reduced to servitude; not, however to
a condition so low as the <i>villeins</i>, who were, properly, the slaves of those
people, and had no property but at the will of their lords. However it is,
no state, except one absolutely barbarous, could subsist without artizans;
and as commerce is the parent of wealth, and as neither it, nor arts, could
thrive where property is not, in some sort, secure, the lords were in some
degree, by their own interest, obliged to relinquish to these people the seizing
of their goods at pleasure, as they practised towards their villeins, and to
leave them at liberty to make regulations among themselves for the benefit
of trade<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus far, then, they were free, but their servitude consisted in their
being liable to taxes, or <i>tailliages</i>, at the will of the lords, who, if they
were wise, laid on such only as they could well bear; but miserable was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
their condition when they fell into the hands of one who was needy and
rapacious; for, then, they were often fleeced, even to ruin and depopulation.
This induced the wiser lords, who saw the consequences, and how
much the arbitrary exertion of such powers must, in the end, hurt themselves,
to restrain their own powers; and, by degrees, by granting them
<i>charters</i>, to emancipate them. They formed them into <i>bodies corporate</i>, confirmed
the right of making <i>bye-laws</i>, which had been permitted them, and
granted them other privileges, or <i>franchises</i>, as they called them, from their
being infranchised, in derogation to former regal or seignoral rights. But
for their total freedom they were indebted to parliament, which, seeing the
bad use king John made of his right in this kind, provided thus in Magna
Charta, <i>Civitas London habeat omnes libertates suas antiquas, &amp; consuetudines
suas. Præterea volumus &amp; concedimus, quod omnes aliæ civitates, burgi, &amp;
villæ, &amp; barones de quinque portubus, &amp; omnes alii portus, habeant omnes libertates
&amp; liberas consuetudines suas.</i> And another chapter restrains the king
from laying new and evil tolls, and confines him to the antient customs<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</p>

<p>Hitherto, however, the citizens and burgesses were no part of the body
politic, and were not represented in parliament. But as, with their security,
their wealth and consequence encreased, about, or before the year 1300,
they were admitted to that privilege; that they might, in conjunction with
the knights of shires, be a check on the overgrown power of the mighty
lords; and about that time also the same privilege was allowed to this class
of people in the other nations of Europe also. This right was confirmed,
and so I may say, the <i>house of commons</i>, in its present condition, formed by
the statute of the thirty-fourth of Edward the First. <i>Nullum tallagium vel
auxilium, per nos vel heredes nostros, in regno nostro ponatur, seu levetur, sine
voluntate &amp; assensu archiepiscoporum, episcoporum, comitum, baronum, militum,
burgensium, &amp; aliorum liberorum communium de regno nostro</i>; where we see,
not only the burgesses, but free yeomen also had representatives, namely,
by their voting along with the knights of the shires, according to the
maxim of that wise prince, <i>Quæ ad omnes pertinent, ab omnibus debent
tractani</i><a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Having come to the constitution of the house of commons as it stands at
present, it will not be amiss to look back, and see how far its present form
agrees with, or differs from the feudal principles. These principles, we
have seen, were principles of liberty; but not of liberty to the whole nation,
nor even to the conquerors; I mean, as to the point I am now upon,
of having a share in the legislation. That was reserved to the military tenants,
and to such of them only as held immediately of the king. And the
lowest and poorest of these also, finding it too burthensome to attend these
parliaments, or assemblies, that were held so frequently, soon, by disuse, lost
their privileges; so that the whole legislature centered in the king, and his
rich immediate tenants, of his barony. And it is no wonder the times were
tempestuous, when there was no mediator, to balance between two so great
contending powers, and were it not that the clergy, who, though sitting as
barons, were in some degree a separate body, and had a peculiar interest of
their own, performed that office, sometimes, by throwing themselves into
the lighter scale, the government must soon have ended either in a despotical
monarchy, or tyrannical oligarchy.</p>

<p>Such were the general assemblies abroad in the feudal countries, but
such were not strictly the <i>wittenagemots</i> of the Saxons, for their constitution
was not exactly feudal. I have observed that the most of their lands were
allodial, and very little held by tenure. The reason I take to be this: On
their settlement in Britain they extirpated, or drove out, the old inhabitants,
and therefore, being in no danger from them, they were under no necessity
of forming a constitution compleatly military. But then those allodial proprietors
being equally freemen, and equal adventurers with these who had
lands given them by tenure, if any in truth had such, they could not be deprived
of their old German rights, of sitting in the public assemblies. From
the old historians, who call these meetings <i>infinita multituda</i>, it appears that
they sat in person, not by representation<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.</p>

<p>This constitution, however, vanished with the conquest, when all the
lands became feudal, and none but the immediate military tenants were admitted.
We find, indeed, in the fourth year of William the First, twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
men summoned from every county, and Sir Matthew Hale will have this
to be as effectual a parliament as any in England<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>; but, with deference to
so great an authority, I apprehend that these were not members of the legislature,
but only assistants to that body. For if they were part thereof, how
came they afterwards to be discontinued till Henry the Third’s time, where
we first find any account of the commons? The truth seems to be, that
they were summoned on a particular occasion, and for a purpose that none
but they could answer. On his coronation he had sworn to govern by Edward
the Confessor’s laws, which had been some of them reduced into writing,
but the greater part were the immemorial custom of the realm; and
he having distributed his confiscations, which were almost the whole of
England, into his follower’s hands, who were foreigners, and strangers to
what these laws and customs were, it was necessary to have them ascertained;
and, for this purpose, he summoned these twelve Saxons from every county,
to inform him and his lords what the antient laws were. And that they
were not legislators, I think appears from this, that when William wanted
to revive the Danish laws, which had been abolished by the Confessor, as
coming nearer to his own Norman laws, they prevailed against him, not by
refusing their consent, but by tears and prayers, and adjurations, by the
soul of Edward his benefactor.</p>

<p>Thus William’s laws were no other than the Confessor’s, except that by
one new one, he dextrously, by general words, unperceived by the English,
because couched in terms of the foreign feudal law, turned all the allodial
lands, which had remained unforfeited in the proprietor’s hands, into
military tenures. From that time, until the latter end of Henry the Third’s
reign, our parliaments bore the exact face of those on the continent in that
age; but then, in order to do some justice to the lesser barons, and the
lower military tenants, who were entitled by the principles of the constitution
to be present, but disabled by indigence to be so in person, they were
allowed to appear by representation, as were the boroughs about the same
time, or soon after. The persons entitled to vote in these elections for
knights of the shire, were, in my apprehension, only the minor barons, and
tenants by knight service, for they were the only persons that had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
omitted, and had a right before, or perhaps with them, the king’s immediate
socage tenants <i>in capite</i>.</p>

<p>But certain it is, the law that settled this had soon, with regard to liberty,
a great and favourable extension, by which all freemen, whether holding
of the king mediately or immediately, by military tenure or otherwise, were
admitted equally to vote; and none were excluded from that privilege, except
villeins, copy-holders, and tenants in antient demesne. That so great
a deviation from the feudal principles of government happened in so short a
time, can only be accounted for by conjecture. For records, or history, do
not inform us. I shall guess then, that the great barons, who, at the end
of Henry the Third’s reign, had been subject to forfeiture, and obliged to
submit, and accept of mercy, were duly sensible of the design the king had
in introducing this new body of legislators, and sensible that it was aimed
against them, could not oppose it. But, however, they attempted, and
for some time succeeded to elude the effects of it, by insisting that all freemen,
whether they held of the king, or of any other lord, should be equally
admitted to the right of the representation.</p>

<p>The king, whose profession was to be a patron of liberty, Edward the
First, could not oppose this; and as he was a prince of great wisdom and
foresight, I think it is not irrational to suppose, that he might be pleased to
see even the vassals of his lords, act in some sort independently of them,
and look immediately to the king their lord’s lord. The effect was certainly
this, by the power and influence their great fortunes gave them in the
country, the majority of the commons were, for a long time, more in the
dominion of the lords than of the crown; though, if the king was either a
wise or a good prince, they were even then a considerable check upon the
too mighty peers.</p>

<p>Every day, and by insensible steps, their house advanced in reputation
and privileges and power; but since Henry the Seventh’s time, the progress
has been very great. The encrease of commerce gave the commons
ability to purchase; the extravagance of the lords gave them an inclination,
the laws of that king gave them a power to alienate their intailed estates;
insomuch that, as the share of property which the commons have is so disproportionate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
to that of the king and nobles, and that power is said to follow
property, the opinion of many is, that, in our present situation, our
government leans too much to the popular side; while others, though they
admit it is so in appearance, reflecting what a number of the house of commons
are returned by indigent boroughs, who are wholly in the power of
a few great men, think the weight of the government is rather oligarchical<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.</p>

<p><i>The privilege of voting for Knights of the Shire—The business of the different
branches of the Legislature, distinct and separate—The method of passing
laws—The history and form of the legislature in Ireland.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The house of commons growing daily in consequence, and the socage
tenants having got the same privilege of voting for the knights of
the shire as the military ones, it naturally followed, that every free person
was ambitious of tendering his vote, and thereby of claiming a share in the
legislature of his country. The number of persons, many of them indigent,
resorting to such elections, introduced many inconveniences, which are taken
notice of, and remedied by the statute of the eighth of Henry the sixth
chapter the seventh which recites, that of late “elections of knights had
been made by very great, outrageous, and excessive numbers of people of
which the most part was of people of small substance, and of no value,
whereof every one of them pretended a voice equivalent with the most
worthy knights and esquires, whereby manslaughter, riots, batteries, and
divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties
shall very likely rise and be, unless convenient and due remedy be provided
in this behalf;” and then it provides that, “no persons should
have votes, but such as have lands or tenements to the value of forty
shillings a year above all charges.” And so the law stands at this day,
though by the change in the value of money, by the spirit of this statute, no
person should have a vote that could not dispend ten pounds a year at least.
Such a regulation, were it now to be made, would, certainly, be of great
advantage both to the representers and represented; but there is little prospect
of its ever taking place: And if it should be proposed, it would be
looked upon as an innovation, though in truth, it would be only returning
to the original principles of the constitution<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>Our legislature, then, consisting of three distinct parts, the king, lords,
and commons, in process of time, each of them grew up to have distinct
privileges, as to the beginning particular businesses. Thus all acts of general
grace and pardon take their rise from the king; acts relative to the
lords and matters of dignity, in that house; and the granting of money in
the commons. How the commons came by this exclusive right, as to money
matters, is not so easy to determine. Certain it is that, originally, the
lords frequently taxed themselves, as did the commons the commonalty,
without any communication with each other; but afterwards, when it was
judged better to lay on general taxes, that should equally affect the whole
nation, these generally took their rise in that house which represented the
bulk of the people; and this, by steadiness and perseverance, they have arrogated
so far into a right peculiar to themselves, as not to allow the lords
a power to change the least title in a money bill. As to laws that relate not
to these peculiar privileges, they now take their rise indifferently either
in the lords or commons, and when framed into a bill, and approved by
both, are presented to the king for his assent; and this has been the practice
for these two or three hundred years past<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.</p>

<p>But the ancient method of passing laws was different, and was not only more
respectful to, but left more power in the crown. The house which
thought a new law expedient, drew up a petition to the king, setting forth
the mischief, and praying that it might be redressed by such or such a remedy.
When both houses had agreed to the petition, it was entered on the
parliament-roll, and presented to the king, who gave such answer as he
thought proper, either consenting in the whole, by saying, <i>let it be as is desired</i>,
or accepting part and refusing or passing by the rest, or refusing the
whole by saying, <i>let the ancient laws be observed</i>, or in a gentler tone, <i>the
king will deliberate</i>. And after his answer was entered on the roll, the
judges met, and on consideration of the petition and answer, drew up the
act, which was sent to be proclaimed in the several counties<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.</p>

<p>Lord Coke very justly observes that these acts drawn up by men, masters
of the law, were generally exceedingly well penned, short, and pithy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
striking at the root of the grievance, and introducing no new ones; whereas
the long and ill penned statutes of later days, drawn up in the houses,
have given occasion to multitudes of doubts and suits, and often, in stopping
one hole, have opened two. However, notwithstanding this inconvenience,
there was good cause for the alteration of method. The judges, if
at the devotion of the court, would sometimes, make the most beneficial
laws elusory, by inserting a salvo to the prerogative, though there was none
in the king’s answer; whereas, by following the present course, the subjects
have reduced the king to his bare affirmative or negative, and he has lost
that privilege, by the disuse of petitions, of accepting that part which was
beneficial to himself, and denying the remainder<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.</p>

<p>I have the rather mentioned this ancient practice of making laws, because
it shews how inconsistent with our constitution is that republican notion,
which was broached by the enemies of Charles the First, that the king,
by his coronation oath, swearing to observe the laws <i>quas vulgus elegerit</i>, was
obliged to pass all bills presented to him, and had no negative. The meaning,
certainly, only extended to his observation of the laws in being. For
if the words were to be construed of future propositions, and in the sense
that those people would put upon them, the lords also, as well as the king,
must be deprived of their power of dissent, and so indeed, it appears, they
expounded it; for when the lords offended them, by refusing the trial of
the king, they confidently enough with the maxim they had established,
turned them out of doors.</p>

<p>But though such as I have mentioned is the constitution of the English
parliament, the form of the legislature in this kingdom hath been for above
two hundred and sixty years very different, the nature of which, and the
causes of its deviation from its model, it is proper every gentleman of this
country should be acquainted with. In the infancy of the English government
in Ireland, the chief governors were generally chosen by the king out
of the lords of the pale, the descendants of the first conquerors, both as they
were better acquainted with the interest, and more concerned in the preservation
of the colony, and also as, by their great possessions, they were
better enabled to support the dignity of the place, whose appointments, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
king’s revenue here being inconsiderable, were very low. These governors,
however, though men of the greatest abilities, and of equal faithfulness to
the crown, were not able to preserve the footing the English had got soon
after the conquest; but were every day losing ground to the natives, down
to the reign of Edward the Third, which is generally, and, I believe, justly,
attributed to the negligence of the English lords, who, by intermarriages,
had acquired great estates in Ireland. The power of these lord lieutenants
was, in one respect, likewise exorbitant, namely, in giving consent to laws
without ever consulting his majesty, a power, perhaps, necessary at first,
when the country was in a perpetual state of war, and its interest would not
brook delays, but certainly, both for the sake of king and people, not fit
to be continued.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, for the king, who found himself ill served, to
change hands, and to entrust this exorbitant power with persons not estated
in the country, and whose attachment he could confide in; and accordingly,
from that time, we find natives of England generally appointed to the government,
to the great discontent of the Irish lords, who looked upon themselves
as injured by the antient practice not being continued. This discontent
was farther inflamed by a very extraordinary step, which this otherwise
wise and just king was prevailed upon to take, and which first gave rise to
that famous distinction between the English by blood, and the English by
birth. This king, and his father Edward the Second, had granted great
estates, and extensive jurisdictions to many Irish lords of English blood, for
services pretended to have been done, many of which, it is probable enough,
as the king alledged, were obtained by deceit and false representation; and
had he contented himself with proceeding in a legal course, by calling
these patents in by <i>scire facias</i>, and vacating them upon proof of the deceit,
no person could have complained; but he took a very different method, as
appears from the writ he thought proper to issue on that occasion. <i>Quia
plures excessivæ donationes terrarum, tenementorum &amp; libertatum, in terra Hiberniæ,
ad minus veracem &amp; subdolam suggestionem petentium, tam per Edward
II. quam per regem nunc factæ sunt, rex delusorias hujusmodi machinationes
volens elidere, de concilio peritarum sibi assistentium, omnes donationes terrarum,
tenementorum, &amp; libertatum prædictarum duxit revocandas, quousque de
meritis personarum, de causis &amp; conditionibus donationum prædictarum fuerit informatus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
&amp; ideo, mandatum est justiciariis regni Hiberniæ, quod omnia terras
tenementa &amp; libertates predicta per dictos regis justiciarios aut locum tenentes suos
quibuscunque personis facto scisire facias.</i> This hasty step alienated the English
Irish from the king and his advisers, and though, after a contest of eleven
years, the king annulled this presumption, the jealousy continued on
both sides, and the Irish of English blood, were too ready to follow the banners
of any pretender to the crown of England.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry the Sixth, that weak prince’s ministers, jealous of
the influence of Richard duke of York in England, and of his pretensions
to the crown, constituted him governor of Ireland; than which they could
not have done a thing more fatal to their master’s family, or to the constitution
of this kingdom, as it turned out in the sequel; for to induce him to
accept it so eager were they to remove him from England, they armed him
almost with regal powers. He was made lieutenant for ten years, had all
the revenue, without account, besides an annual allowance from England;
had power to farm the king’s lands, to place and displace officers, and levy
soldiers at his pleasure. The use the duke made of his commission was to
strengthen his party, and make Ireland an asylum for such of them as should
be oppressed in England; and for this purpose passed an act of parliament,
reciting a prescription, that any person, for any cause, coming into the said
land, had used to receive succour, tuition, supportation, and free liberty
within the said land, during their abiding there, without any grievance,
hurt, or molestation of any person, notwithstanding any writ, privy seal,
great seal, letters missive under signet, or other commandment of the king,
confirming the said prescription, and making it high treason in any person
who should bring in such writs, and so forth, to attach or disturb any such
person.</p>

<p>This act, together with the duke’s popularity, and the great estate he
had in this kingdom, attached the English Irish firmly to his family, insomuch
that, in Henry the Seventh’s reign, they crowned the impostor Lambert
Simnel, and were afterwards ready to join Perkin Warbeck; and by
this act of the duke of York’s they thought to exculpate themselves<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
when that king had trodden down all opposition, he took advantage of the
precarious situation they were in, not only to have that act repealed, and to
deprive his representatives there from passing laws <i>rege inconsulto</i>, but
also to make such a change in the legislature, as would throw the principal
weight into his and his successors’ hands; and this was by the famous law of
Poyning’s<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. By former laws a parliament was to be holden once a year,
and the lords and commons, as in England, were the proposers. This act,
intended to alter these points, gave occasion to many doubts; and indeed,
it seems calculated for the purpose of not disclosing its whole effect at once.
Its principal purport, at first view, seeming to be intended to restrain the
calling the parliament, except on such occasions as the lord lieutenant and
council should see some good causes for it, that should be approved by the
king. The words are, that “from the next parliament that shall be holden
by the king’s commandment and license, no parliament be holden
hereafter in the said land, but at such season as the king’s lieutenant and
council there first do certify the king, under the great seal of that land,
the causes and considerations; and all such acts as to them seemeth should
pass in the same parliament, and such causes, considerations, and acts,
affirmed by the king and his council to be good and expedient for that
land, and his license thereupon, as well in affirmation of the said causes
and acts, as to summon the said parliament under his great seal of England
had and obtained; that done, a parliament to be had and holden
after the form and effect before rehearsed, and any parliament holden
contrary to be deemed void<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.”</p>

<p>The first and great effect of this act was, that it repealed the law for
annual parliaments, and made the lord lieutenant and council, or the king
who had the naming of them, with his council of England, the proposer to
the two houses of the laws to pass, at least of those that should be so devised
before the meeting of parliament. But the great doubt was, as there
were no express words depriving the lords and commons of their former
rights, whether, when the parliament was once met, they had not still the
old right of beginning other bills, or whether they were not restrained to
the acts so certified and returned. By the preambles of some acts, soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
after made, expressing that they were made at the prayer of the commons
in the present parliament assembled, one would be inclined to think that
the commons, after the assembling the parliament, had proposed these laws.
Certain it is, the latter opinion, supported by the ministers of the king and
his lawyers, gained ground. For, in the twenty-eighth of Henry the
Eight’s reign, an act was made suspending Poyning’s law with respect to
all acts already passed, or to be passed in that parliament; the passing of
which act was certainly a strong confirmation of what was before doubtful
against the house of lords or commons in Ireland, whether they could
bring in bills different from those transmitted by the council, since here
they both consented to the suspension of the act, to make valid the laws
they had passed or should pass in that parliament, without that previous
ceremony<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>.</p>

<p>But in the reign of Philip and Mary, by which time this opinion, before
doubtful (for so it is mentioned in the act then made) was, however, to be
maintained, and strengthened, as it added power to the crown. The act
we at present live under was made to prevent all doubts in the former,
which was certainly framed in words calculated to create such doubts, to
be extended in favour of the prerogative. This provides, that as many
causes and considerations for acts not forseen before, may happen during
the sitting of parliament, the lord lieutenant and council may certify them,
and they should pass, if they should be agreed to by the lords and commons.
But the great strokes in this new act were two, the first explanatory of part
of the former in Henry the Seventh’s reign, that is, that the king and council
of England should have power to alter the acts transmitted by the council
of Ireland; secondly, the enacting part, that no acts but such as so came
over, under the great seal of England, should be enacted; which made it
clear, that neither lords or commons in Ireland had a right to frame or
propose bills to the crown, but that they must first be framed in the privy
council of Ireland, afterwards consented to, or altered by the king, and the
same council in England, and then, appearing in the face of bills, be refused
or accepted <i>in toto</i> by the lords and commons here<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>It is true, that both lords and commons have attempted, and gained an
approach towards their antient rights of beginning bills, not in that name,
but under the name of <i>Heads of Bills</i>, to be transmitted by the council; but
as the council are the first beginners of acts of parliament, they have assumed
a power of modelling these also. The legislature of Ireland is, therefore,
very complicated. First, the privy council of Ireland, who, though they
may take the hint from the lords or commons, frame the bill, next the king
and council of England, who have a power of alteration, and really make it
a bill, unalterable, by sending it under the great seal of England; then the
two houses of lords and commons, who must agree in the whole, or reject
the whole; and, if it passes all these, it is presented to the king for his assent;
which indeed is but nominal, as it was before obtained.</p>

</div>

<p>I now proceed to the lowest class of people that were in a feudal kingdom,
who, indeed, were not any part at all of the body politick, namely
<i>copyhold tenants</i>, <i>tenants in ancient demesne</i>, and <i>villeins</i>, on which I shall
not much enlarge as villenage is worn out both in England and Ireland;
and though the two former are common in England, yet there are none
such in this kingdom. I shall begin with <i>villenage</i>, though the lowest kind,
as I apprehend the other two by the tacit consent of their lords, have for
ages, from being villeins acquired the privileges that distinguished them
from such.</p>

<p>In a former lecture I gave it as my opinion, that, while the nations of the
north continued in Germany, there was no such order of men among them;
but that the persons among those people who were called <i>servi</i> by Cæsar
and Tacitus, were the predecessors of the <i>socmen</i> or <i>socage tenants</i> in the feudal
monarchy; though they certainly had not all the privileges the socmen
acquired, and that, after their settlements in their conquests, this rank was
introduced, and formed out of their captives taken in war, in imitation of
the Roman slaves. In this I am strongly supported by my lord Coke, who
quotes Bracton, Fleta, and the Mirror, concerning their origin, to the following
purpose: “The condition of villeins who passed from freedom into
bondage in ancient time grew by the constitution of nations, and not
by law of nature; in which time all things were common to all, and by
multiplication of people, and making proper and private those things
that were common, arose battles. And then it was ordained by constitution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
of nations (he means by the tacit consent of civilized nations) that
none should kill another, but that he that was taken in battle should remain
bond to his taker for ever, and he to do with him, and all that should
come of him, his will and pleasure, as with his beast or any other cattle,
to give, or to sell, or to kill. And after, it was ordained for the cruelty
of some lords, that none should kill them, and that the life and members
of them, as well as of freemen, were in the hands and protection of
kings, and that he that killed his villein should have the same judgment
as if he had killed a freeman<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>.” This, it falls also to be observed, is the
very account the Roman civil law gives of the original of servitude.</p>

<p>Villenage, therefore, was a state of servitude, erected for the purpose
of doing the most ignoble, laborious, and servile offices to the lord, according
to his will and pleasure, whensoever called upon; such as the instances
<i>Littleton</i> gives, of carrying and recarrying dung, and spreading it on his
lord’s land. <i>Bracton</i>, thus defines it <i>purum villenagium est, a quo prestatur
servitium incertum indeterminatum, ubi scire non poterit vespere quale servitium,
fieri debet mane</i>, viz. <i>Ubi quis facere tenetur quicquid ei præceptum fuerit</i>. So
the most honourable service, the military one, was free, and its duties uncertain.
The next in rank, the socage was free, and its duties certain.
This, the lowest, was servile, and its duties uncertain<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

<p>Of those villeins there were two kinds, villeins belonging to the person
of the lord and his heirs, which our law calls <i>villeins in gross</i>, and <i>villeins
belonging to the land of the lord</i>, and who, in consequence of the lands being
aliened, went over to the new acquirer, without any special grant. These
were in the Roman law, called, <i>servi adscriptitii glebæ</i>, that is, slaves annexed
to the soil, and by our lawyers <i>villeins</i> regardant to a manor; for manors
were, antiently, thus distributed. After the lord had reserved to himself
a demesne contiguous to his castle, sufficient for the purpose of his house
and his cattle, the remainder was generally divided into four parts; the first
for settling such a number of military tenants as might always more than suffice
to do the service due to the superior lord; the second for socage tenants,
to plow the lord’s demesne, or, in lieu thereof, to render corn, cattle, or
other things as stipulated by him; the third for villeins, for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
carrying dung, felling timber, making inclosures, and other servile offices,
as required by the lord at his pleasure; and the last share of land, was called
the <i>waste</i>, or <i>common</i>, being generally woodland, and coarse pasture, the wood
for the lord’s hunting, for supplying him with timber at his pleasure, and the
tenants with reasonable <i>estovers</i> as they are called, out of the woods, in those
three articles, <i>housebote</i> for the support of their houses, <i>sloughbote</i>, for their
utensils of husbandry, and <i>firebote</i>, for fewel; and the pasture for the cattle
of all the tenants, military, socage, and villeins in common. This was the
usual method of distribution, not however into equal parts, for the demesne
and waste were generally much the largest, nor always into the same number
of parts, for this varied according to the quantity and quality of the
land, whether better or worse, and the military service reserved, whether
lighter or heavier<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p>From this distribution we may see that, in most manors, there was land
which, having been originally set apart to the use of the villeins, was called
villein-land, which retained its name, and was liable to the same name,
and servile services, though it had come into the hands of freemen, who,
consequently, though free, might hold lands in villenage, and be obliged to
do the same uncertain services as a villein was. Few freemen however we
may suppose, would submit to such uncertain burthens, and therefore when
they took such lands, the lord generally reduced the service to a certainty,
and this tenure, because of the low nature of the duties they performed, was
also, though abusively, called <i>villenage</i>. But speaking with propriety, it was
socage, the tenant being a freeman, and the services certain. Certainty of
service being, as I have often mentioned, the grand characteristic that distinguished
the socage tenure from the military above it, and from villenage
below it.</p>

<p>Let us now see what kind of property this rank of people had in their
persons, their lands and their chattles; for from what has been already observed,
some kind of property they must have had, or they could not have performed
the services. And the first rule is, that, with respect to every person
but his lord alone, a villein was perfectly a freeman. His life, his liberty,
his property, were equally protected by the law, as those of any other person.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
He could acquire, he could alien property, he could be plaintiff in all
kinds of actions whatsoever; but if defendant he might plead his being a
villein. As to his lord, his case was very different. His life, indeed, his
liberty, his limbs, were under the protection of the king; and if in these
he was injured by his lord, the lord should be punished at the suit of the
king, as in the case of any other subject, but not at his own suit. However,
there was two excepted cases, where the law (for they most certainly
punished the two detestable crimes of murder and rape) gave a villein actions
against the lord, namely an <i>appeal</i>, that is an accusation in his own
name of murder, where the lord had killed the villein’s ancestor; and appeal
of rape, where the lord had ravished his <i>neif</i>, for so a bond woman, or
female villein, or <i>nief</i>, is called in our law. And here if the lord was found
guilty, the villein, or <i>neif</i>, were by that judgment manumized for ever. For it
would have been a glaring absurdity, to have afterward trusted them in the
power of the heir of that lord, whom they had hanged. Neither had a villein,
with respect to his daughter, the same power of disposing her in marriage
without the lord’s consent as he had of his son. And this distinction
was founded upon solid reason, for the son of a villein, after his marriage,
and his issue, continued in the same plight as he was in before, villeins to the
lord; but the daughter, by her marriage, passed into another family, and
her issue were either to be freemen, if her husband was free, or villeins to
the other lord, if her husband was such; so that the lord had a very important
interest in his seeing his villein’s daughter married to another villein of
his. This previous consent, however, wore out by degrees, and by the
custom of particular places, a certain fine was all that the lord could claim
for the marriage.</p>

<p>With respect to the lands the villein held from his lord, and also as to
his chattels, or personal fortune, he was only tenant, or possessor at the will
of the lord; for he the lord might resume the one, or take possession of the
other whenever he pleased; but in the interim they were the villeins, and he
might convert the profits of them to his own use, unless they were also in
being and seized; the seizure of them being what made the absolute property
in the lord. And the case was the same with respect to purchases, or
acquisitions of lands or goods; for before the seizure, or some other public
act equivalent thereto, the villein might alien them as well as the goods he
had held before at the will of the lord, and the alienation was good against
the lord, and the reason of this was undeniable. For it would have put a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
total stop to all commerce both of goods and land, if every buyer was obliged,
at his peril, to make enquiry, and to take notice whether the seller
may not possibly, in truth, be a villein to some one of the many lords in the
kingdom; and it would have been highly absurd to allow the lord to seize
the lands, or goods in the hands of the purchaser, when he might seize the
purchase money likewise in the hands of his villein, the seller; I say it is the
seizure, or some other public act equivalent thereto, that vests the property
in the lord; for, in all cases, an actual seizure was not possible. A few instances
will clear this up<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.</p>

<p>If the villein purchases lands in possession in fee simple, fee tail, life, or
years, the lord should, if he had a mind to make them his, enter, and claim
them; or if, for fear of danger, he dare not enter, should come as nigh to
the lands as he dare, and claim them there. And this was sufficient to vest
the estate in the lord, according to the nature of the estate the villein had
in it, and to defeat a future purchaser; even though the lord should suffer
the villein to continue in the possession. For the purchaser is obliged, at
his peril, to take notice of all legal acts of notoriety, done respecting the
lands he purchases. But if the villein purchases land not in possession, as suppose
a remainder, or reversion, where there is a prior estate for life or lives,
or in tail, in another person in being; here the lord cannot enter, for that
would be disseizing, and doing wrong to the immediate tenant of the freehold;
and if he waited till that estate was spent, and the remainder or reversion
was to come into possession, the villein might have aliened them before,
and so defeated his lord. He should, therefore, in such case, come to the
land, and claim the reversion or remainder, as his villein’s purchase. And
this act presently is sufficient to vest them, the reversion or remainder in him,
and to defeat a future purchaser. So if a villein purchased an advowson,
or presentation to a living, where the parson of the church is living, the
lord cannot present, which is the proper act to gain possession of the advowson.
For the church is full of an incumbent, but he shall come to the church,
and claim the advowson as his villein’s purchase; and this vests the advowson
in him, and will defeat a future alienation by his villein. In the same
way with respect to goods; the lord may either seize them, and retain them
in his own hands, or may come to the place where they are, and openly
claim them before the neighbours, and seize a part of them in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the whole goods his villein <i>hath</i>; and this shall vest the property in him,
though he leaves the possession still in his villein; and if he adds the words
or <i>may have</i>, it vests the property of goods after acquired, though it is otherwise
of lands.</p>

<p>From this power of the lord as to his villein’s property, it appears the
villein can bring no action relative to property against him; for all such actions,
being either to recover the thing itself, or damages for the wrong done,
in both cases, it would be useless, and improper. For, inasmuch as the lord
had right to take, the taking could be no injury, and to give damages even
for a personal injury would be absurd and nugatory, since the lord might
immediately, as soon as recovered rightfully, retake them from his villein.
Therefore Littleton says, “a villein cannot have an appeal of maim against
his lord that hath maimed him<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.” For, as the law then stood, <i>maim</i> was
only punishable by fine and imprisonment, at the suit of the king, or by damages,
in an appeal of maim, at the suit of the party. Neither could he
have an appeal of robbery against him, though that offence, with respect to
freemen, was capital; for the lord having a right to take, could not be
guilty of robbery. However, there was one excepted case, wherein the
lord could not take things out of his own villein’s hands, and wherein the
villein also might maintain an action against him; but then, in this case,
the villein acted not in his own right, but in that of another, <i>in autre droit</i>,
as our law says, which was when a villein was made an executor. For here
he acted not in his own right, but as representative of his testator, for the
performance of whose will, and for no other purpose, he had allowed to him
this possession against his lord, and this right of action against him.</p>

<p>Let us now see how many different ways a man might be a villein, how
many ways the villenage, or its effects, may be suspended, and how many
ways it might be totally destroyed.</p>

<p>Now a man might be a villein either by birth, or become such by his
own act. With respect to birth, our law considers only the condition of
the father, whether free or villein, contrary to the civil law, where the
maxim is <i>partus sequitur ventrem</i>. Our rule seems more agreeable to natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
reason, as the husband is master of the family, the head of the wife,
and supposed, at least, the principal party in the production of the offspring.
Yet the Roman law is not therefore to be charged with absurdity, it proceeding
on a principle peculiar to itself, namely, that they allowed no matrimony
but between free persons; a cohabitation between two slaves, or
between a slave and a free person, was called <i>Contubernium</i>, not <i>Nuptiæ</i>,
nor <i>Matrimonium</i>; and to such a commerce their law did not give such continuance,
or entire credit, as to presume the father to be certain. A freewoman
who so far disgraced herself as to cohabit with a slave, they supposed
equally guilty with others; and therefore, as the father was uncertain,
<i>in favorem libertatis</i>, they presumed him a freeman. And, on the
contrary, though a freeman cohabited with a slave, that law gave no credit
to her constancy, but rather supposed the issue begat by one of her own
rank, another slave. But in England, if the father was free or slave, the
issue was so; for our law admitting such marriages as good ones, upon the
maxim, <i>whom God hath joined let no man sunder</i>, gave them an entire credit.
What then shall we say was the case of <i>bastards</i>, where the father was
entirely unknown, and who were <i>filii nullius</i>. Some old opinion in England
indeed held, that if the mother was a neif, because she was certain, the
issue should be a villein; but this doctrine was exploded, and it was settled
that, as the child was, by our law, to follow the rank of his father, and
who that was, was entirely uncertain, it should be universally presumed in
favour of liberty, that the father was a freeman, whatever the mother was.
A bastard, therefore, could not be a villein, but by his own act; and how
a man could become so I shall next proceed to shew<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.</p>

<p>There was then but one way for a freeman born to become a villein, I
mean in the latter ages, when the practice of making slaves of captives taken
in war went into disuse, and that was by his admission and confession.
For <i>volenti non fit injuria</i> is a maxim of all laws, and in the antient times of
confusion, it might be an advantage, at some times, to a poor freeman to
put himself, even in this law manner, under the protection of a lord that
was both powerful and humane. But so careful was the English law of liberty
that it did not allow every confession or admission to conclude against
a man’s liberty, but such an one only as could not proceed from mistake, inadvertence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
or constraint. The confession must be made in a court of record,
and entered on record. Then indeed was it conclusive, for it is a
maxim of our law, that there is no averring against a record, that is, charging
it, or the contents thereof, with falsehood. For if that could be, property
could never receive a final determination, nor a man be certain that
the suit that he had obtained might not be renewed against him<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.</p>

<p>But the law went farther in its precautions, and would not suffer any
confession, even in a court of record, to destroy liberty. If a man came voluntarily
into such a court, and made an extrajudicial confession, that is
where there was no suit depending, and contested in that court, it could
not bind him. The confession, to bind, must be made in such a court, and
in a suit litigated there; so that there might be no room afterwards for pretending
surprize, error, constraint, or terror. Thus, if a stranger brought
any action against a man (for if the lord brings any action, except one kind
only, against his villein, he the villein, is thereby manumized, as I shall observe
hereafter) I say, if a stranger, A, brought an action against B, and B,
to bar A, of his action, pleads on record, as he may, that he is villein to C,
this confession shall bind him, and he shall be C’s villein, though he was in
truth a freeman; yea though A, in that very action, had replied that B
was a freeman, and had even proved him such: And indeed this was but a
just punishment for his fraudulent attempt to deprive A of his action.</p>

<p>Again, if a lord, claiming a man to be his villein, bring the writ called
<i>nativo habendo</i>, the proper one to prove this fact, that the defendant was
his villein, and the defendant confesses himself judicially so to be, he and his
issue are bound, though he was free before; or if the defendant, in such
case, pleads he is a freeman, and the lord, to prove him his villein, produces
the defendant’s uncles, or cousins, who swear, that they and their ancestors,
from time immemorial, or from a time antecedent to the separation
of family, have been villeins to that lord and his ancestors, whatever becomes
of the original suit, they themselves thenceforwards are the lord’s
villeins; and though they were in truth free, it is but a just punishment, as
I observed before, for their foul attempt of reducing their kinsman to slavery.
However, as we must allow that every man is fond of his own and his posterity’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
liberty, we must accordingly believe that these instances of freemen
becoming slaves voluntary were very rare, and, that the majority of villeins
were such as were so by birth. Before I leave this head, I should observe
that, with respect to the issue of men becoming villeins by their own confession,
the issue born after the confession alone were bond, as being so born,
and that the children born before, retained the liberty they had acquired by
their birth.</p>

<p>Villenage could not only be totally destroyed by many means, but also
might be suspended for a time, and afterwards revive. The suspension arose
from some subsequent obligation the villein, or nief, happened to lie under,
which the law considered, and favoured more than the lord’s right in his villein,
or nief; therefore, if the king made a villein a knight, such a creation,
being for the defence of, and to encrease the military strength of the realm,
and the person obliged to serve accordingly, his state of villenage was suspended,
not destroyed. For, if he was afterwards degraded from his order,
he became the lord’s villein again, so if a villein became a monk professed,
now was he obliged to live entirely in his monastery, and spend his time in
prayers, and other spiritual exercises, duties inconsistent with his service as
a villein; and those being performed to God were preferred to the interest
of the lord; but if such monk was deraigned, that is, degraded from his
order, and turned out of his monastery, he became a secular man again, and
the lord’s right revived. But if a villein is made a secular priest, he not
being confined to a monastery, nor his whole time dedicated to the service
of God, he is still a villein and obliged to attend his lord at all times, when
the stated times or occasions of his new duty do not employ him. So if a
nief marries a freeman, the right of the husband in his wife, as founded on
the law of God and nature, is preferred to the lord’s, though prior, which
is founded only on the constitutions of nations: She, therefore, is priviledged,
and a free woman during the coverture; but if the husband dies, or
a divorce happens, then is she a nief again. But it may be asked, shall the
lord thus, without any fault of, or consent from him, be, by the act of
others, deprived, even for a time, of his right in his villein, and the advantage
thence arising? I answer, though the law, for the public good, suspended
the villenage, it did not leave the lord without redress for the wrong
done unto him. For, in the cases of profession and marriage, the lord shall
have his action against, and recover the damages he may sustain, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
abbot who had admitted his villein a monk, or the husband who married
his nief; but against the king who has knighted his villein, he cannot have
an action, for, according to the principles of the feudal law, to bring an
action against the king is a breach of fealty: it is charging him with injustice,
and with breaking that mutual bond, whereby he is tied to his vassals
as strictly as they are tied to him. But he shall not be without remedy.
He shall have his action, and recover damages against those, who by
their aid, advice, counsel, or recommendation prevailed on the king to
make his villein a knight. Coke mentions two cases more, wherein I cannot
say so fully as he says, the <i>villenage itself</i> is suspended, as that the <i>effects</i>
thereof are suspended, as to a certain place; and both these are in honour
of the king, one is when a villein escapes from his lord, and has continued
for a year and a day in the demesne of the king, doing service to him as
his villein. The lord can neither seize him, nor even bring a writ of <i>nativo
habendo</i> against him while he continues in the royal demesne. The other
is where a villein is made a secular priest in the king’s chapel. The lord
cannot seize him in the presence of the king<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>.</p>

<p>We shall next have a more agreeable subject, and by considering the many
ways the law of England hath contrived to destroy villenage, have the
pleasure of observing its natural bent toward the equal liberty of mankind,
and how it rejoiced to shake off the shackles of servitude, even in those days
when it admitted it.</p>

<p><i>The methods invented to destroy villenage—The bent of the law of England
towards liberty—Copyhold tenants—Tenants in ancient demesne.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Relative to villenage, the following are the words of the antient judge
Fortescue, who wrote a treatise on the grounds of the English law, for
the instruction of his pupil, the unfortunate son of the unfortunate king
Henry the Sixth. <i>Ab homine, &amp; pro vitio introducta est servitus; sed libertas
a Deo hominis est indita naturæ. Quare ipsa ab homine sublata semper redire
gliscit, ut facit omne quod libertate naturali privatur<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</i> We are now to see
how, and in how many ways, our law favours this natural propensity to liberty.
And the first and plainest is a direct enfranchisement, or, as the Romans
called it, <i>manumission</i>. This, in the ancient times, before writing was
common, used to be done, as all their important acts, (for the better preserving
them in memory) in great form. <i>Qui servum suum liberum facit, in
ecclesia, vel mercato, vel comitatu, vel hundredo</i>, (<i>that is, the county court or
hundred court</i>) <i>coram testibus, &amp; palam faciat, et liberas ei vias, &amp; portas conscribit
apertas, &amp; lanceam, &amp; gladium, vel quæ liberorum arma in manibus ei
ponat<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.</i> But after the use of writing became common, the method was by
the lord’s deed (mentioning him to be his villein, and expressly infranchising
him) sealed by the lord’s seal, and attested by proper witnesses, as other
deeds between freemen should be<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>Before I go farther, I should observe the favour of the English laws to
liberty in that, by it all manumission, of what kind soever, was absolute and
irrevocable. Once a freeman, and ever so; whereas by the civil law, a freedman
was bound to many duties towards his patron. A relation between them
still subsisted, and if he was guilty of ingratitude, that is, of any of the
many offences their law marked as such, he was again to be reduced to
slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>But besides this species of express enfranchisement, there were many
implied ones. First, by the a act of the lord alone, and others by construction
of law, upon the act either of lord or villein. By the act of the lord
alone, namely, if he had entered into any solemn certain contract with his
villein, giving him thereby either a permanent right of property, or a power
to bring an action against his lord. In such cases he was instantly manumized,
without express words; for, otherwise, he could not have the benefit
of the gift intended, and the lord’s act, in such cases, should be construed
most wrongly against himself. As if the lord gives land to his villein
and his heirs, or to him and the heirs of his body, or to him for life; immediately
on the giving livery and seizin, which was, as I have often observed,
what compleated an estate of freehold, and made it irrevocable, the
villein became free. Otherwise he could not enjoy the benefit of the grant,
or protect it against his lord.</p>

<p>The same was the case if the lord gave him any certain property, as a
bond for payment of a sum of money, or a yearly annuity, or a lease of
lands for years. The villein could not securely enjoy the benefit of the
gift, without being able to bring an action against his lord, and consequently
being free against him. Yea, though the annuity or lease of land was
but for years, the manumission was absolute for ever, and not suspended
for the years only; which was different from the cases I put in my last lecture,
of villenage being suspended by the act, not of the lord, but another
person; but here where the lord himself, by his own act, set him free,
though but for a time, he was free for ever. But if the lord gave his villein
lands to hold at will; this being of the same nature with the proper
holdings of villeins, and the lord having reserved in his own breast a power
of ousting whenever he pleased, the villein gaining thereby no certain property,
he continued in his former situation.</p>

<p>Secondly, a man may be enfranchised without express words, by construction
of law, operating on the act either of the lord or villein. If a lord
had a mind to dispossess his villein of lands, or of goods, he had a right to
enter on the lands, or seize the goods, without ceremony; but if, waving
this right, he brought an action against him for them, or if he brought not
any action personal against him, but the one of <i>Nativo Habendo</i>, the villein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
was enfranchised, whether the lord recovered or not, or whether he prosecuted
the action or not. For when he omitted the easy remedy the law
appointed, and brought his villein into court to defend his right, he admitted
him to be a person that could stand in judgment against him, and litigate
with him; that is, to be a freeman. But it must be observed this enfranchisement
did not commence immediately from the taking out the writ,
which was the commencement of the action, but from the appearance of
both plaintiff and defendant, and this for the benefit of the lord; for otherwise,
as Coke observes, a stranger, by collusion with a villein, might take
out an action against him in his lord’s name. To which I may add, that
the lord might have intended his action against a freeman of the same name
with the villein, and the sheriff might have summoned the villein by mistake.
In this case it was hard that the lord should suffer. He therefore might,
when he saw the villein ready to appear, nonsuit himself, that is, decline
appearing; and then the villein could not appear, and therefore was not
enfranchised. But if he went on, and suffered his villein to appear, and
consequently enabled him to plead against him, he must have abided by the
consequences of his own folly, and his nonsuiting himself afterwards could
in no sort avail him<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.</p>

<p>A villein might likewise be manumitted by his lord’s bringing a criminal
action against him, though this was no admission of permanent property in
him, or of his capacity of standing in law against him as a freeman; as if
the lord brought an appeal of felony, as of murder, or robbery, against
him. If he was acquitted he might be enfranchised, because he might be
entitled to recover damages for the malicious prosecution, and the danger
his life had been in; and damages he could not recover without being a
freeman. I say <i>might</i> be enfranchised, because he <i>might</i> recover damages.
For in this case a distinction is to be taken, whether the villein was, before
the appeal brought, indicted at the suit of the king for the same offence, or
was not. If he was not, the acquittal shewed the prosecution to be malicious,
and the villein was entitled to recover damages, and so to be free. But
if he had been indicted, there were no grounds to suppose the appeal brought
maliciously. The finding the indictment by the grand jury was a presumption
of his guilt. The lord had a rational ground for bringing his appeal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
and he had a right to bring it for the punishment of his villein, if guilty.
Otherwise he could not have him hanged, for the indictment at the king’s
suit might not be prosecuted, or the king might pardon. In such case,
therefore, there being no malice presumed, the law gave no damages, and
consequently no enfranchisement. But the lord’s bringing the writ called
<i>Nativo habendo</i> against his villein, namely, claiming a man to be his, as such,
was no enfranchisement, for that would defeat the ends of the suit; and the
law allowed the lord a power to seize his villein without further ceremony,
it did not precisely compel him to that method only, for his villein might
be at too remote a distance, or under the protection of persons too powerful.
But if, after appearance, the lord suffered himself to be nonsuited, in
this action, it was an enfranchisement.</p>

<p>The law, likewise, enfranchised in some cases on the act of the villein
himself, as if the lord had been found guilty in an appeal of murder, brought
by his villein, or of rape by his nief; but these I mentioned in the last lecture,
and the reason is apparent.</p>

<p>By all these various ways the number of villeins insensibly diminished,
and the number of freemen continued to encrease in every reign; but what
gave the finishing stroke to servitude were the confusions occasioned by the
two contending houses of York and Lancaster; when the whole kingdom
was divided, and every lord obliged, even for his own security, to take part
with one side or the other; and when once engaged, necessitated to support
his party with his whole force. Villeins were, therefore, emancipated in
prodigious numbers, in order to their becoming soldiers. Many of such,
also, who had not been formerly emancipated, in those times of distraction,
fled for self-preservation to London, and other cities, where, being absent
from their lords, they were looked upon as free; and where they generally
continued, even after these troubles had ceased, unknown to the heirs of
the antient lords; and in consequence, for want of proof of their servitude
within fifty years last past, (which was the time of limitation for this action)
most of them and their posterity became free. When things afterwards
became composed, under Henry the Seventh, many of these persons were
by the heirs of their former lords reclaimed, and recovered as villeins, though,
undoubtedly, the far greater part escaped undiscovered. But even in those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
actions that were brought, both judges and juries were very favourable to
the persons claimed; the juries out of favour to liberty, and the judges, I
presume, following the policy of that reign, one of the great objects of which
was the depression of the great lords; to which nothing could more contribute
than the lessening the number of the persons who were held in such
strict dependance by them, and the profits of whose industry they had right
to seize, to encrease their wealth and their power<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing which had, long before that period, lessened their numbers,
was the rise of copyhold tenants. These are persons who are said to
hold lands <i>at will, but according to the custom of a manor</i>, and those arose from
the villenage tenants, as I conceive, by the following means. When a succession
of mild and humane lords had neglected, for a long time, to seize
their villeins goods, or to exact villein service, so that no memory remained
of their having made use of such a practice, they came to be considered in
another light, and became exempted from that seizure by prescription.
For the lord claiming a villein in a <i>nativo habendo</i>, must plead, and prove,
that he, or his ancestors, had exacted such services, from the person claimed,
or his ancestors, otherwise he failed. Therefore, in the case I have mentioned,
though a future lord had an inclination to depart from the practice of
his predecessors, and revive his rights, he could not recover them for want
of proof; and these persons so long indulged, became freemen. However
their lands, (they being only tenants at will) might still be resumed, until,
at last, they got, likewise, by the same kind of prescription, a permanent
right in them also, in the way I now shall relate.</p>

<p>If a lord had given his villein any certain estate, it was, as I before observed,
an absolute manumission for ever. But some lords, either in reward
for services done, or out of bounty, gave many of those underling tenants,
if not an absolute right to their holdings, at least, a fair claim and
title to a permanent estate, which, in honour, the lord or his heirs could
not defeat, and yet kept them in a particular kind of dependance, between
freedom and absolute villenage. But the question was how this was to be
done; for if the lord had given him a deed, to assure him the lands, and so
entered into a contract with him, he was entirely emancipated. The way
was then for the lord to enter into the roll of his court, wherein he kept the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
list of his tenants, that he had given such an one an estate at will, to hold to
him and his heirs, or to him and the heirs of his body, or to him for life or
years; and these directions being constantly complied with, grew by length
of time into established rights, and they came to be called <i>tenants at will, according
to the custom of the manor</i>.</p>

<p>They were still called tenants at will, because, they had been originally
such, for they were never considered as, nor called, <i>freeholders</i>, until very
lately, in one instance, they were admitted to vote for members of parliament,
and their votes allowed by the house of commons. This decision
was greatly exclaimed against by the tories, who were foiled by this reception,
as proceeding from a spirit of party, and as being contrary to the rules
of the antient law, as it certainly was. But, on the other hand, it was agreeable
to common reason and justice, and to the spirit and principles also,
though not to the practice of the antient constitution. For when Edward
the First lays down this maxim, <i>quæ ad omnes pertinent ab omnibus debent
tractari</i>, what reason can be assigned why a copyholder for life, who has a
valuable, and as certain estate, in fact, as a freeholder, though called by a
different name, and who contributes equally to the taxes and expences of
the government, should not have equal privileges, and be equally intitled to
be represented. They are called <i>copyholders</i>, from the evidence they had of
their titles. The evidence that freemen had of their estates in land was either
a <i>deed</i>, if the grant was by deed, or if it was without deed, the <i>livery
and seizen</i>, attested by the witnesses present; but the copyholder had no
deed, neither was livery and seizen given to him, as he was originally but a
tenant at will. His evidence, therefore, was a copy of the rule entered in
the lord’s court roll, which was his title, and from hence was he named
copyholder<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.</p>

<p>The peculiarities attending this kind of tenure, that distinguished it from
other tenures, arose from their being considered as tenants at will. Hence
arose that antient opinion, that if a lord ousted his copyholder, he could
have no remedy by action in the king’s court against him: But had this
been the law that since prevailed, all copyholders had been long since destroyed.
Therefore, in Edward the Fourth’s reign, it came to be settled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
that if the lord turned out his copyholder, he might well maintain an action
of ejectment against him, as a tenant for years could, or else they might sue
the lord in equity to be restored.</p>

<p>From the same principle of its having been an estate at will, arose the
right of the lord to a fine, upon the change either of lord or tenant; upon
the change of the lord by the act of God only, that is by his death; upon
the change of the tenant, either by the act of God, by his death; or by his
own act, by his alienation. But the tenant paid no fine on the lord’s alienation;
for if he was so to do, he might be ruined by being frequently charged.
These fines were an acknowledgment of the lord’s ancient right of
removing them, and were, in some places, by custom, fixed at a certain rate;
in others, they were uncertain, and settled by the lord: However, he was
not allowed to exact an unreasonable one, for if so, the tenancy would have
been absolutely in his power, and of the reasonableness of the fine the judges
of the king’s courts were to determine.</p>

<p>I mentioned the alienation of copyholders, but to alien directly they
could not, being esteemed but tenants at will, yet what they cannot directly
do, they may indirectly, by observing certain forms; that is, by surrendering
to the lord, to the use of such a person, and then the lord is, in
equity, compellable to admit into the copyhold the person for whose use it
is surrendered. These surrenders are either made in the manor court, or
out of it. If made in court, it is immediately entered in the court roll; if
out of court, it should be presented at the next court day, and then entered.
The surrender out of court must be made to the lord himself, or to the
steward of the manor, or it is not good; except in some particular manors
by custom, where it may be surrendered to the lord’s bailiff, or to two or
more of the copyholders, who are to present it at court. When a surrender
was made, the lord was only an instrument to hand it over, and therefore
must admit that grantee into such estate, and no other, whom the grantor
had appointed in his surrender. In many cases a court of equity will supply
the want of a surrender.</p>

<p>Copyholders could not devise their lands by will for two reasons. First,
that, in general, lands were not devisable till the reign of Henry the Eighth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
and for another reason peculiar to themselves, that, being called tenants at
will, they were not looked upon to have a sure and permanent estate. But
when, after the invention of <i>uses</i>, a way was found out to evade the general
law, and to make lands go by will, by the owner granting his estate to another
for the use of himself, the grantor, for life, and after, for the use of
such persons as he, the grantor, should name in his will; and when courts
of equity were found disposed to oblige the grantee to perform the trust he
had undertaken, in imitation hereof, copyhold estates began to be surrendered
to the lord to the use of the copyholder’s last will; and then the lord,
after his death, was obliged to admit such person as he appointed in such his
will, and in the mean time, the copyholder enjoyed during his life, for the
surrender only did not transfer the estate, except it was to the lord’s own use.
If to any other use, the lord was but an instrument, and the land remained in
the surrenderer until the admittance of the new tenant, which, in the case
I have put, could not be till the old one was dead.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity arising from the same source, there being tenancies
at will, was, that neither the husband could be tenant by the courtesy, nor
the wife tenant in dower. The reason was, that every estate at will determined
by the death of the tenant, neither could an estate tail be created of a copyhold;
for the statutes <i>De Donis</i> extended not to them, and, therefore, if a
gift was made in such words as would, at this day, create such an estate, it
would be in the nature of a <i>fee simple conditional</i> at common law. However,
by special custom in particular manors, copyhold might be entailed; might
go to the tenant by the courtesy, and the wife might be endowed thereout<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much I have thought requisite to shew the general nature of this
tenure, and of its origin. More would be needless to say here, as there
are no such in this kingdom, though the law relating to them makes a considerable
part of the law of England. For the same reason I shall be very
short as to the tenants in antient demesne.</p>

<p>Lands in <i>antient demesne</i> are the estates that the king had, as king, to
support his family, and other expences, and were antiently unalienable.
They were the lands of Edward the Confessor, and the Conqueror. But
as the king could not make profit of them himself, they were given to tenants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of two kinds, freeholders and copyholders. The law with respect to
them stands as it does with other freeholders and copyholders, except that
they have some peculiar privileges. The general reason of these privileges
was, that the freeholders were originally socage, and the copyholders the
villenage tenants of the king, and had these privileges granted to them because
they were supposed constantly employed on the king’s land, to furnish
him with corn, cattle, and other necessaries; and their privileges have
continued, though the services have been changed into money, and the
estates almost all alienated from the crown. These are principally as follow:
They are exempted from all burthens and taxes laid on by parliament, unless
they are specially named. They are not to be taxed for the wages of
the knights of the shire. They are not to pay toll, or passage money for goods
bought and sold in markets, for all things concerning husbandry and sustenance.
They are not to be impleaded in any court, only in their manor
court, nor to be summoned as jurymen, with some other privileges of the
like nature, not necessary to be here insisted on<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.</p>

<p>Having drawn a rough delineation of a feudal monarchy, and given
a general account of the ranks of people of which it was composed,
and of their distinct rights and privileges, it will next be proper, agreeably
to what I first proposed, to observe, through the several reigns, the progress
of English law, and by what steps and gradations it is come to differ so
widely from what it was in its original; not, indeed, to go minutely through
all the alterations made, for that would be a task that could not be confined
within the compass of these lectures, but to point out the great and considerable
changes, which had extensive influences, and contributed to give
the law a new face. But, before I enter upon this, it will not be amiss to
look back a little, and to say something with respect to the law in the Saxon
times, since much of that remained after the conquest, and even makes a
part of our law at this day.</p>

<p>The Saxons, being a German nation, brought into England the customs
of that country, customs very similar to, and, in many instances, exactly
the same with those used abroad on the continent. However, with respect
to their military policy, it was not so strict and perfect as that of the Franks,
occasioned, as I suppose, by their greater security from danger. For they
had no reason to dread the Britons, having extirpated many, and expelled
the rest, except a few whom they kept in the meanest offices, in the nature
of villeins. Neither was the authority of their kings so great as abroad, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the founders of the kingdoms of the heptarchy were not kings in Germany,
as the kings of the Franks and other nations had been, but only leaders
of adventurers, who voluntarily associated themselves, and therefore could
have no authority but what their followers confirmed upon them; and
that it was not very considerable, appears from this, that every thing of
great moment was transacted in their general assemblies or <i>wittenagemots</i><a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>.</p>

<p>These kings were elective, though generally those of the same family,
(for to this also there were some exceptions) were elected. Offa says of himself
to his people, <i>Electus ad libertatis vestræ tuitionem, non meis meritis, sed
sola liberalitate vestra</i>. From the death of a former king to the election of
a new one there was an <i>interregnum</i>, and even during these interregnums
they made laws. For when the excellent king <i>Brithric</i> had been poisoned
by his queen, they enacted a law, that if any future king should give his
wife the title of queen, he should forfeit his dignity, and his subjects should
be free from their oath of allegiance; and then they proceeded to elect Egbert,
Brithric’s tenth cousin. And, in pursuance of this law, Ethelbald,
deposed his father, for giving that title to Judith of France. Alfred, indeed,
was not chosen upon a vacancy, but claiming a part of the kingdom
before the assembly at Swinburn, by virtue of an agreement with his brother
Ethelred, that assembly annulled the agreement, as destructive to the
nation, then threatened by the Danes, but enacted that Alfred should succeed
to the whole, though Ethelred, and also their elder brother Ethelbert
left sons<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.</p>

<p>I know it is generally said that these three brothers succeeded by their
father’s will, and so the Conqueror pretended a will of Edward the Confessor
in his favour, but what had Ethelwulf to leave, but the little kingdom
of Kent, which was assigned to him upon his deposition. Besides his will
was, that they should succeed in case of issue failing, and they succeeded
though there were sons; and Alfred, who should know his own title best,
acknowledged he had received his crown from the bounty of the princes,
elders, and people. Here I should mention, that the kings had not a right
to marry themselves without the consent of their people, for of Alfred it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
observed, that he did so, <i>contra morem &amp; statuta</i>, not only against custom,
but against positive laws. To go through no more particulars; it appears
from history, that all the kings of the Saxon race were elected; so were
the Danes; so was the last Harold, though not of royal blood, and though
Edgar Atheling, who was the lawful heir, had the kingdom been hereditary,
was living; so was the Conqueror, and that was the just title he had.
But enough of this point.</p>

<p>To see how justice was administered among the Saxons; the kingdom, for
this purpose was divided into <i>shires</i>, those into <i>hundreds</i>, or, as we call them
in this kingdom (Ireland,) <i>baronies</i>, and these into <i>tithings</i>, so called because
they originally consisted of ten contiguous families, over which a <i>tithingman</i>
presided. Every man, in these tithings, was bound to keep the peace, not
only for himself, but for the others of his tithing; and if one of them
committed a crime, the rest were obliged to search him out, and produce
him for trial; otherwise the tithing was grievously amerced. This division
of the kingdom into <i>counties</i>, and their subdivisions, is generally ascribed
to king Alfred. That the division of hundreds into tithings was
his is undoubted; and it is probable the division of counties into hundreds
was his also; that the people, beggared by the Danish incursions, might
have justice rendered to them nearer their own homes, without the expence,
the fatigue, and even danger of travelling to the county town. But as to
counties, they certainly were more antient. Justice could not be administered,
according to the principles of the German policy, in a country so
large as one of the kingdoms of the heptarchy, without its being subdivided;
and accordingly, during those times, before the union of these
kingdoms into one, we find, in the old laws, the mention of <i>shires</i> and
<i>sheriffs</i><a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>.</p>

<p>But though Alfred was not the first maker of the divisions, we are not
therefore to charge the writers that give that account with falsity. Even before
his reign the Danes had made settlements in England, in the northern
parts. In the very beginning of it they reduced him to content himself with
the countries south of the Bristol channel and Thames, with the addition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Essex, which, in their ravages, they had thrown into the greatest confusion.
The rest of England was left as their prey, in which, after ravaging it several
years, they fixed themselves, until, at length this great prince, to
whom no king, I may say, no man, whom history has recorded, was superior,
either for piety to God, for a strict love of justice, for a fatherly affection
to his people, for heroism in battle, for fortitude of mind (that never
despaired in the lowest state of his affairs, when all seemed desperate) or for
a wisdom capable of directing upon every occasion the proper measures to
be taken by the state over which he presided; I say, until this great prince
trampled his enemies under his feet, and obliged the Danes, who had so
long looked upon him with contempt to sue to become his subjects, and to
receive the lands they had usurped, from him as their king and lord. For
to expel them was impossible, and if it had been otherwise, and the matter
had been effected, they had committed such massacres in the lands they possessed,
that the country would have been desolate. Then, indeed, this
king settled the limits of shires or counties, through all England; in Essex,
and the counties south of the Thames, I presume, according to the old limits.
For if we allow for one county being more woody, or having more
unprofitable land than another, they appear to bear no great disproportion
to each other. But, as to the lands the Danes held, it was different, for
here, to win his new subjects, he was to accommodate the division somewhat
to that which they had made among themselves, under their several
leaders. Hence, in that part of England which was then Danish, we find
the greatest difference between the size and value of the lands in the several
counties, some excessively large, and others as exceedingly small; which,
I think, is no way to be accounted for, in so wise a prince, but that the
several tribes of these Danes were to be kept in their old bounds, and separate
from each other. In such a succession of ages, undoubtedly, these
boundaries have received alterations, but they could not have received such
as would account for the disproportion; and in truth we find the Danes
had divided the land before he conquered them.</p>

<p>In those counties and hundreds justice was administered to the inhabitants
near their homes, without the delays and expences of resorting to Westminster.
The court held by the sheriff, assisted by the bishop, was, in its origin,
as we find in the red book of the exchequer, and had cognizance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
four several matters that were handled, in this order. First, all offences against
religion and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction were tried. The bishop, or his
commissary, here was judge, and the sheriff was his assistant; and if the delinquent
disregarded the censures of the church, he enforced the sentence by
imprisonment. Next were tried temporal offences, that concerned the publick,
as felonies, breach of the peace, nuisances, and many others. Here
the sheriff was judge, and the bishop was assistant, to enforce the sentence
with ecclesiastical censures. Thirdly, were tried civil actions, as titles to
lands, and suit upon debt or contracts. Here the sheriff presided, but the
<i>suitors of the court</i>, as they were called, that is, the freeholders, were the
judges, or as we now say, the <i>jury</i>, and the sheriff executed the judgment,
assisted by the bishop, if need were. Lastly there was held an <i>inquest</i>, to see
that every person above twelve years of age who was in some tything, had
taken the oath of allegiance, and found security to the king for his good
demeanor. This was called the <i>view of frank pledge</i>, that is, the viewing
that every person had nine freemen pledges or security for his loyalty to
the king, and his peaceable behaviour to his fellow subjects<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.</p>

<p>But since the time of king Edgar, at least, this court has been divided
into two, the criminal matters, both ecclesiastical and civil, and also the
view of frank pledge was dispatched in one court called the <i>tourn</i>, that is,
the <i>circuit</i>, from the bishop and sheriffs going circuit through the county;
and the civil business was dispatched in another, called, the <i>county court</i>.
The law was, that the sheriff and bishop should twice in the year go their
circuit or tourn, namely, in the month following Easter, and the month
following Michaelmas; and should hold their court in every hundred of the
county; but the view of frank pledge was to be taken only once a year,
namely the tourn after Easter. But for the more ready dispatching civil
causes, the county court was held once a month, that is in twenty-eight
<i>days</i>, reckoning a month by four weeks and not by the calendar<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.</p>

<p>Out of these courts were others afterwards derived, for the more easy
and expeditious way of distributing justice. Out of the sheriff’s tourn, were
two, the <i>hundred court</i>, and the <i>court leet</i>, and they had cognizance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
same matters the tourn had, and were erected independent of the sheriff’s
tourn, for the mutual ease of him and the inhabitants, where, in large counties,
the hundred lay too remote to be conveniently visited in the circuit.
But many inconveniencies arising from the sheriff’s power not running in
these separated jurisdictions, the hundred court, which was held by the
steward of the hundred, were all, except a very few, that had been given
in fee to some great men, reunited to the tourn, and so they vanished in
Edward the Third’s reign<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.</p>

<p>The leet was of the same nature as the hundred court, derived out of
the tourn, and made a separate jurisdiction; but it was held in the name of
a subject, by the lord of the manor’s steward, and to the lord belonged the
profits of the courts leet. They were, however, though held by a subject,
in his own name, esteemed as the king’s courts, and allowed to be courts of
record, as well as the tourn from which they sprung.</p>

<p>Out of the county court, which was for private causes, was derived the
<i>court baron</i>. It was held from three weeks to three weeks, as all courts
were in the early Saxon times. It was when a manor was exempted from
the sheriff’s county court, and the jurisdiction granted to the lord, to hold
plea of civil suits. In this the suitors were the judges, as in the county
court<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<p>In these several courts was justice administered in the Saxon times, and
even for a considerable time after the conquest, for the most part. But soon
after that time inconveniencies were found, partly from the partiality of the
judges in these inferior courts, and partly, from their ignorance in law.
Then began the higher court to draw to themselves the jurisdiction of these
matters, and the county courts to be confined to pleas of such matters as exceeded
forty shillings in value. The pleas of lands were likewise brought
in there, and discussed either in the higher courts, or before justices of <i>nisi
prius</i>. The appointment of <i>justices errant</i>, and <i>justices of assize</i>; of <i>justices of
goal delivery</i>, and of the <i>quarter sessions</i>, together with the many powers
granted by divers acts of parliament to one or more justices of the peace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
have, in a succession of ages, continually sunk the business of these courts,
and have left them but a shadow of what they were.</p>

<p>But although most of the business in the old times was in these inferior
courts, there was one superior, that even in the Saxon times, had a concurrent
jurisdiction with them, the <i>curia regis</i>. The curia regis sat in the king’s
palace, and removed with him from one part of the kingdom to another,
generally in the king’s hall; except when they judged questions belonging
to the king’s treasure, when they sat in his treasury, called the <i>exchequer</i>,
from the chequered cloth wherewith the table was covered. The judges
were, the judiciary, the chancellor, and the treasurer, together with such
great lords as were attendant on the court; so that, in parliament time, all
the great lords sat there; and this was the foundation of the lords judicature
in parliament. The judiciary presided in all cases that did not concern
the revenues, and indeed his power was so exorbitant by the antient law,
being regent of the kingdom in the king’s absence, that sometime after the
conquest, the kings thought proper to abolish the office, and divide even his
judicial power into several hands<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<p>The chancellor was one of the most learned ecclesiastics. It fell, therefore,
naturally to his province to make out all writs, and processes, and letters
patent, and consequently the great seal of the kingdom was lodged with
him. He attended, likewise, something in the nature of an equity judge;
not that there was any such thing as a distinct <i>court of equity</i>, but, as a learned
and pious man, to direct with his advice whenever the case happened,
where conscience dictated one way and the strict law another. The treasurer
was present also to take care that the king had his fines from offenders,
which he was afterwards to collect into the exchequer where he presided,
where also he set leases of the king’s lands for years, collected his rents and
debts, and took care of his escheats and forfeitures. The proper jurisdiction
of this court was where the king was concerned in interest as to his revenue;
where one of the great peers was to be tried for heinous offences, or even
where two persons had been guilty of crimes that seemed to have a general
influence, and tended to general confusion. For unless the crime of a lower
person was very heinous indeed, he was tried in the country, in the tourn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>Civil causes likewise between the great lords fell under their inspection,
but those between meaner persons they seldom meddled with, unless they had
for difficulty been referred or adjourned to them from the courts below, and
if they, in that case, found the cause of great difficulty, they adjourned it to
the <i>curia regis</i> in full parliament. However, as they had the power of judging
civil causes between all persons in the first instance, if they thought the
cause of such a nature, that justice was not likely to be done in the country,
they had many applications from such as had those apprehensions; and as this
court had a discretionary power, either of sending them back to the county-court,
or of admitting them here, this gave an occasion for exacting fines for
license to plead in the king’s court, and thereby of increasing his revenue;
until at length, when the inferior courts declined in reputation, and every
man sought for justice in the <i>curia regis</i>, these fines, being arbitrary, became
an intolerable grievance, which was remedied by those famous words in
Magna Charta, <i>Nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus justitiam</i>, as I shall observe
hereafter. Such were the courts held in the Saxon times, and for some
time after the conquest, whose several jurisdictions it is proper to point out,
for the better understanding of the alterations that afterward ensued<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.</p>

<p>I next proceed to the <i>method of trial</i>, or determining the matters in issue
in these courts. And they were the same that were used abroad, which I
have already mentioned, and shall therefore barely run them over. First,
<i>ordeal</i>, either by putting their hands in boiling water, or holding a red
hot bar of iron in their hands; or by <i>cold water</i>, that is, tying their hands together,
and their feet together, and throwing the person accused into a pond;
and this method the ignorant vulgar have adopted to try witches. Secondly,
the <i>oath</i> of the party, with <i>compurgators</i>, or, as it is called, <i>waging his law</i>;
and in this manner was Earl Goodwin acquitted of the murder of Alfred,
king Ethelred’s brother. Thirdly, <i>battle</i>, which was the usual method of
trying the title to lands, and appeals of felony, or capital crimes.</p>

<p>If a man was indicted of felony at the king’s suit, he could not offer
battle; for challenging the king was a breach of allegiance, but if he was
appealed of felony by a subject, he had his choice either of battle, or submitting
to be tried by a jury. But if he waged battle, he must fight in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
proper person, whereas the appellant, who might be an infant, or decrepid
with age, or a man of religion, or a woman, was allowed a champion. If
lands were demanded from a man, he had, likewise, the option of trial by
battle, or by <i>grand assize</i>. If by battle, then were both parties allowed
champions, if they desired it; but the champion, in such case, must first
swear, that he knows the land was the right of the party he fought for, or
that his father told him he knew it, and charged him to bear witness thereof.
So that this trial was referring it to the providence of God, which of
the two contradictory witnesses, the champions, swore true<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.</p>

<p>The other method was by the grand assize. <i>Assize</i>, coming from <i>assides</i>,
to fit together, signifies a jury. It was called <i>grand</i>, because of its number.
The sheriff returned four knights, who chose twelve knights more, and
their verdict determined. But the most usual method of trial among the
<i>Saxons</i> was by <i>juries</i>, as at this day, that is, by twelve of the <i>pares curiæ</i>.
The invention of these is attributed by the English lawyers to Alfred, and
greatly do they exult over the laws of other countries in the excellency of
this method. But had they been acquainted with the ancient laws of the
continent, they would have found the trial by <i>pares</i> common to all the
northern nations, though since wore out by the introduction of the civil
law; not so common, indeed, any where as in England; where every age
it gained ground, and wore out the other<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>. Alfred’s merit, therefore, was
rather in fixing the number, and determining the qualities of the jurors,
than in the invention; but what these several qualifications were, will come
in more properly in another place.</p>

<p><i>The punishment of public crimes and private wrongs among the Saxons—The
ranks of men among the Saxons—The difficulty of ascertaining the nature of the
Saxon estates, and the tenures by which they were held—Observations to prove
that the Saxon lands were in general allodial.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In my last I gave an account of the courts wherein the Saxons administered
justice, and of the several methods of trial used in them; it will
be proper to add a few words concerning their <i>punishment</i> of persons found
guilty either of public crimes or private wrongs. When I spoke of the
customs of the German nations, while they lived in that country, I observed,
that all offences were punished by <i>fines</i> only, and none by <i>death</i>,
two only excepted, desertion in war, and the rape of a married woman.
The nations descended from them, when they settled within the limits of
the Roman empire, continued the same practice for some ages, as did the
Saxons also in England.</p>

<p>All wrong and crimes, not excepting murder and high treason, were
redeemable by fine and imprisonment, until the Heptarchy was declined;
and for this purpose their laws assigned the several mulcts that were to be
paid for the different offences. Murder was rated higher or lower according
to the quality of the person slain. That of their king himself was valued
at thirty thousand <i>thrymsæ</i>, a piece of their money. But afterwards it
was found necessary to inflict capital punishments. Treason, murder, rape,
and robbery, were of the number so punished, though the punishment of
rape was afterwards <i>castration</i>; but after the Conquest it was made capital
again. Corrupt administration of justice was another; for it is recorded,
to the praise of Alfred, that he hanged forty four unjust judges in one year<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.
These were the judges in the tourns, ealdermen of the counties, or their deputies
the sheriffs. Other offences against the public continued punishable
by fine and imprisonment, and satisfaction for private wrongs was obtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
either by restoration of the thing unjustly detained, if it was extant, or a
compensation to the value in damages, if it was not<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the order and ranks of people among them, there were, properly
speaking, but two, <i>freemen</i> and <i>villeins</i>. The last, I presume, were the
remains of the antient Britons, but among the freemen there were various
orders, not distinguished by any hereditary difference of blood, but by the
dignities of the offices they held by the gift of the king. Not that we are
to imagine there was no regard whatsoever paid to the descendants of great
and illustrious men. As their king was eligible out of the royal family
only, so were there a number of other families, to whom the enjoyment of
these honourable offices were, I may say, confined, not by any positive distinctive
law, but by general practice, and by the king’s constantly choosing
out of them; and who may, with propriety enough be called the <i>nobility</i>.
Those honorary offices were of different ranks of dignity; such as those
of <i>ealdermen</i> or <i>earls</i>, <i>coples</i>, or as they were sometimes called <i>Thanes</i>, <i>Præpositi</i>,
or rulers of hundreds; all of whom were, originally, removeable at
the king’s pleasure, though, unless they misbehaved, they were generally
continued for life.</p>

<p>Some, indeed, have thought that earldoms were hereditary, even in the
Saxon times, because they see that earl Goodwin’s son succeeded him, and
the same was true in some other families also. But there is a great difference
between a son’s succeeding to his father by a legal right of inheritance,
and his succeeding either by the voluntary favour of the king, or
by his extorted favour, when a family has grown so powerful, as to make
it a necessary act in the king, in order to preserve public peace. The latter
was the case with respect to earl Goodwin’s family. Edward the Confessor
hated him mortally for the death of his brother Alfred, as he did his whole
family for his sake. However, as he owed the crown solely to his interest
and intrigues, as he was well acquainted with the power, and knew that he
had spirit enough to attempt dethroning him, if once offended, that prince,
who was careless of what came after him, so he might reign in peace during
life, caressed Goodwin and his family; dissembled all resentment, and, after
one or two weak struggles, let him and his family govern the kingdom at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
their pleasure; a conduct that raised them still higher in the opinions of the
people, and concurring with the incapacity of Edgar Atheling, Edward’s
nephew, raised Harold to the throne, as the only man in England capable
of defending it against two powerful invaders<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

<p>But the great difficulty is to know what kind of <i>estates</i> the Saxons had in
their lands, and by what <i>tenures</i> they held them. This question hath divided
the lawyers and antiquaries of England; some holding that the tenures
were as strictly feudal, as after the conquest, while others as strongly deny it.
I shall not, in this difficult point, pretend to decide absolutely where so
great masters differ, but only make some observations that perhaps would
induce one to believe, that the Saxon lands were, in general, <i>allodial</i>, some
of them military benefices for life, and none, or, if any, at least very few
feudal inheritances; and this I take to be the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>First, then, the Saxon lands in general, were inheritances, descendable
to heirs; and were all subject to military service. An <i>Heriot</i>, which is contended
to be the same as the Norman <i>relief</i>, was paid upon the death of the
ancestor, and all landholders took the oath of allegiance, or of fealty, as
they would have it; and therefore, Coke and others conclude that their
lands were feudal, and held by knight service; and tho’ there are no traces
either of <i>wardship</i> or <i>marriage</i> to be met with in those times, they insist
that they, as fruits of knight service, must have been in use tho’ from
the paucity of the Saxon records remaining, they cannot be discovered<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.</p>

<p>This reasoning seems to have great strength, and yet, if we examine with
a little attention, perhaps, these very arguments, when well considered, will
prove the contrary, <i>viz.</i> that most of the Saxons lands were allodial.</p>

<p>First, then, as to their being hereditary: This, singly, is far from being
a proof of their being held by a feudal tenure. The lands of the Greeks, of
the Romans, I may say of all nations, except the conquering Germans, nay,
the allodial lands in their conquests, were hereditary. Their being so
seems rather a proof of their not being founded on the feudal policy; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
the military benefices did not become inheritances any great length of time
before the conquest; whereas there is no ground to believe that the Saxon
lands were ever otherwise. Besides, they had some qualities that are utterly
incompatible with the feudal system. They were not only inheritances,
but were <i>alienable</i> at the pleasure of the owner, without any leave from the
superior, and were, likewise, devisable by will; so that the Saxons were absolute
masters of their land, and not obliged to transmit to the blood the donor
intended to favour, contrary to the feudal law abroad, and to our law
after the conquest. I shall observe, by the way, that some lands in England
in particular places, being by custom devisable by will after the conquest,
was a relict of the old general Saxon law, those places not having, along
with the rest of the kingdom, embraced the feudal maxim<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.</p>

<p>Another striking difference is, that the Saxons’ lands were not forfeitable
for felony, which still remains by custom in the <i>gavelkind</i> lands in Kent,
whence that country proverb, <i>the father to the bough and the son to the plough</i>.
Their lands likewise were equally divisable among all the sons, as were gavelkind
lands; which is a customary relict of the Saxon law, contrary to
general rule, since the conquest, where, at first, the king chose one, and afterwards,
as at this day, the eldest alone succeeded. But this last I will not
urge against their being of feudal origin, for that was the antient law of
fiefs; it only shews there was a considerable alteration introduced at the
conquest. However, though their being inheritances singly will not prove
them fiefs, yet, when that is joined to the military tenure, to the payment of
reliefs, and to the oath of fealty, we must allow them to be such. Let us
see then, whether any of them, singly, or taken all together, will enable
us to draw that conclusion<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>.</p>

<p>Certain it is, then, that all the lands in England were, in the Saxon
times, liable to military service; but this will not prove that they were feudal.
For, as I have observed in a former lecture, the allodial lands in
France were subject to the same. Every man who held land as an allodial
tenant, was, according to the quantity, either to find a foot soldier equipped
for the wars, or to join with another to find one, if he had not land sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
These allodial lands were subjected by law to three sorts of duties.
The first I have mentioned, the other two were building, and repairing
bridges, and furnishing waggons and carriages for the conveyance of arms
and the king’s provisions, or money<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>The Saxon lands were, likewise, subject to what they called <i>trinoda necessitas</i>,
the three knotted obligation. The first was, furnishing a foot soldier;
the second, which was not in the allodial lands abroad, was <i>arcis constructio</i>
the building and keeping in repair castles and forts, where the king, for
the public good, ordered them to be erected; and lastly, <i>pontis constructio</i>
the building and repairing of bridges. As to furnishing carriages, the Saxon
freemen were exempted; these being supplied, in that constitution, by
the lower tenants in ancient demesne; or the king had a right to seize any
man’s carriages by his purveyors, and use them upon paying for them.
This right of purveyance of carriages, and of timber, and of provisions for
the king’s household, which was intended for the king’s benefit, and by
which no loss was to accrue to the subject, as he was to be paid the value,
became, in the hands of the greedy purveyors, an occasion of great grievances;
those officers seizing, often more than was wanted, often where nothing
was wanted, merely to force the proprietor to a composition of money
on restoring them. The manner of payment, too, became very oppressive.
The rates were fixed at first at the due value, but as the rate of money
changed, and the prices of things rose, it came to be under the half, and as
it was not paid for on the spot, but by tickets on the treasurer, the owners,
were frequently put to more trouble and expence in attendance than the value
of their demand. This the purveyors well knew, and therefore turned
their office into an engine of extortion. Many were the proclamations issued
by the king; many the acts of parliament made to regulate it; But the evil
was inveterate, and proved very heavy even under the best princes. The
complaints of these oppressions were as great under Elizabeth as under her
successor James, and indeed, the evil was so inveterate, that nothing but
cutting it up by the roots, the destroying purveyance itself, could cure it<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>But to return to the military duty done by the Saxons in general for
their lands. In the first place, then, they served as foot soldiers, and not
on horseback, and in compleat armour, as the feudal tenants were obliged.
Again, the feudal tenants attended not but when called upon, whereas, the
Saxons had regular times of meeting and mustering, though not summoned,
in order to see that the men were well trained, and properly armed.
But the great difference lay in this, that no particular person was bound to
military duty, in consideration of his tenure in the lands. The lands themselves
were liable. Every hide of land found a man, whether it was in the
hands of one, or more persons. There was then no personal attendance,
and, consequently, no commutation for it. The hide of land supported its
soldier, while he continued fighting in his own county; but if in another,
he was to be maintained either by that county, or the king; whereas, the
military tenants, by the feudal law, were obliged to serve forty days at their
own expence, wherever the king pleased, if the war was a just, or a defensive
one; and indeed, as William the Conqueror modelled it, if the war
was even unjust, or offensive. These differences, added to what I have already
observed, concerning their lands not being escheatable for felony,
being alienable, and being devisable by will, I think, shew plainly that,
though the lands were subject to military service, it was upon grounds
and principles very different from the feudal ones, and that they were rather
in the nature of the allodial lands on the continent.</p>

<p>As to <i>Herriots</i>, which Coke and his followers insist much upon, as being
<i>reliefs</i>, they also, when thoroughly considered, will, perhaps, be found to be
of a different nature. A Herriot was a title the landlord had from his tenants,
and the king, as supreme landlord, from his, of seizing, the best
beast of his dead tenant, or his armour, if he was a military man. These
being due upon the death of the tenant, certainly bore some resemblance to
the reliefs on the continent, and are in king Canute’s law, which was written
in Latin, called by the name of <i>relevatio</i>. To shew what they were in
that time, the <i>relevatio</i>, or Herriot of an earl, was eight horses, four saddled,
four unsaddled, four helmets, four coats of mail, eight lances, eight
shields, four swords, and two hundred marks of gold; of the king’s thane
four horses, two saddled, two unsaddled, two swords, four lances, four
shields, his helmet and coat of mail, and fifty marks of gold; of the middling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
thane, a horse with his furniture, with his arms. But, then, Spelman
justly observes, that these were not paid by the heir, as a relief to the
lords, to entitle him to enter on the inheritance. The heir had the lands
immediately and was not obliged to defer his entry till he had paid them,
as he was his relief by the feudal law, and by the law of England after the
conquest. Nay, they were not paid by the heir at law, but by the executor
or administrator, as a perquisite out of the tenant’s personal fortune<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>.</p>

<p>However, William the Conqueror, finding these perquisites in use, and
that in Latin they were called <i>relevationes</i>, took advantage thereof, and as
the forfeited lands he bestowed on his Normans were given upon the terms,
and with the same burthens as lands on the continent, so were the reliefs
he exacted from such in the same manner, made payable by the heir, not
the executor; and as to the unforfeited lands, which remained to the Saxons,
and were very inconsiderable in number, he, in the manner I shall
shew in the next lecture, converted them, into real fiefs, such as were
then in use in France; from whence the reliefs came, likewise, to be exacted
from the heir, and to be considered as redemptions of the inheritance,
which, upon the principles of the feudal policy, could not be entered upon
by the heir till the relief was paid. This alteration it was not in the Saxon
landholders power to oppose, on the account before-mentioned; nor, indeed,
was the burthen on the heir such, if no consequences were to be apprehended
from it, as deserved opposition; for William fixed the reliefs at
a certainty, at the same rate, or with very little addition, as the Herriots
were in Canute’s law.</p>

<p>But experience soon shewed what effects might follow from the construction
of Norman judges, at the devotion of a king, upon the word <i>relevium</i>
being used, and its becoming payable by the heir, instead of the executor;
his son and successor insisted that reliefs were by the feudal law arbitrary,
and looked upon his father’s limiting them as a void act, that could not bind
his successors. He, accordingly, exacted arbitrary and excessive reliefs both
from the Norman and Saxon landholders in England, which exasperated
both equally against him; for though the reliefs in France were, by no law,
as yet reduced to a certainty, yet by custom they were to be reasonable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
and not to be merely at the will and discretion of the king or lord; in consequence
of which he was, on some occasions, forced to depend almost entirely,
in his wars with Normandy, on the mercenary army of the lower
English, who had no property; and had his reign continued much longer,
it is extremely probable he would have felt severely for the oppressions he
laid his military tenants of both nations under. But he dying in ten years,
Henry was obliged, before he was elected, to swear to observe the laws of
Edward the Confessor, which he did, with such emendations as his father
the Conqueror had made; and accordingly, as to <i>reliefs</i> he faithfully observed
his oath; but it being inconvenient for the heir, who was at a call to
perform military duty, to be obliged to pay his relief in arms, which he
might want on a sudden emergency, it was therefore, generally commuted
for money. However, there being no settled rate fixed, at which this commutation
should be regulated, this also was made an engine of oppression
in John’s reign, until it was finally fixed at a certain sum of money, according
to the different ranks of the persons, by <i>Magna Charta</i><a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the last argument, of the <i>Oath of fealty</i> being taken by the Saxons,
it is the weakest of all. An oath of fealty taken by a feudal tenant, was to
his <i>lord</i>, whether king or not. It was merely as tenant to him of land, and
in consideration of such, and consequently the proprietors of land only
were to take it. The oath the Saxons took, which is likened to this, was
to the king, as king not as landlord, and not at all in consideration of
land; for every male person above the age of twelve years was obliged to
take this oath among the Saxons, whether he had lands or not. In truth,
it was no more than an oath of allegiance to the king, as king, which was
common in all kingdoms, and not peculiar to those where the feudal
maxims prevailed<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>.</p>

<p>Hence I think I have some liberty to conclude, though I do it with due
deference, as the greatest masters in the antient laws and records of England
have been divided in this point, that the very reasons urged to prove that
lands were held in the Saxon times as feudal inheritances, prove rather the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
contrary, and that they were, in the general I mean, of the nature of the
allodial lands on the continent.</p>

<p>In my next I shall speak of the alterations introduced by the conqueror,
both as to the tenure of lands in England, and as to the administration of
justice, which were so remarkable, as to deserve to be considered with the
strictest attention, as they laid the foundation for the great alterations that
have followed since.</p>

<p><i>The Saxons, though their lands in general were allodial, were not strangers to
military benefices for life—The alterations introduced by William the Norman,
as to the tenure of lands in England.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Though, in my last, I have delivered my opinion, that the lands
of the Saxons were not feudal, but allodial, I would not be understood
as if there were no lands held by them upon military service, different
from the allodial I have already described. It is undeniable, that there
was among them <i>lord</i> and <i>vassal</i>; that there were lands held by such military
service as was performed abroad; where the bond of fealty subsisted
between lord and tenant, and where the tenants were obliged to serve in
person on horseback. But these were few; for the strength of the Saxon
army lay in their infantry. Besides, such were not feudal inheritances, but
benefices for life, for, in all the records remaining of them, there is not a
word implying an estate that could descend, or a single trace of <i>wardship</i>,
<i>marriage</i>, or <i>relief</i>, the necessary concomitants of such estates. What puts
that out of all doubt, in my apprehension, is one of the laws of William
himself, where he says it was he that granted lands <i>in feudum, jure hæreditario</i>,
which words are added, by way of distinguishing the estates he
granted from the military estates for life, in use before. The word <i>feudum</i>
alone would have been sufficient, had that law been in use before, and the
words <i>jure hæreditario</i> were added by way of explanation of <i>feudum</i>; and
<i>feudum</i> is added by way of distinction from allodial inheritances<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.</p>

<p>When these military benefices began among the Saxons, I cannot say
is determined, but shall offer a conjecture, that carries a great face of probability.
That they were not coeval with the Heptarchy is certain; for
none of the German nations had, at that time, fixed estates for life in their
military holdings. What time, then, so probable as the days of Egbert,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
who had resided long in the court of Charlemagne, where these tenures
were in use, and where he saw the benefit of them? Besides, this was the
very time that a body of horse began to be wanted, who could move swiftly
to encounter the Danes, then beginning their ravages, and whose practice
it was to land in separate bodies, and to kill and plunder, until a superior
force assembled, and then reimbarking, to commit the same devastations
on some other defenceless part of the coast. But these kind of tenures,
as I observed before, could be but few, as most of the lands were
inheritances appropriated to particular families.</p>

<p>To come now to William. A single battle, wherein Harold and the
flower of the nobility were slain, determined the fate of England. However,
many of the great men survived, and the bulk of the nation were
averse to his pretensions. A weak attempt was made to set up Edgar
Atheling, the only prince remaining of the royal race, but the intrigues of
the clergy, who were almost universally on the invader’s side (on account
of his being under the protection of the pope, and having received from
him a consecrated banner) co-operating with the approach of his victorious
army, soon put an end to Edgar’s shadow of royalty. He submitted, as
did his associates, and they were all received, not only with kindness but
with many high marks of distinction. William, accordingly, was crowned
with the unanimous consent of the nation, upon swearing to the laws of
Edward the Confessor; and it must be owned he behaved, during his first
stay, with the utmost equal justice and impartiality between the Normans
and natives. But the continuing to act in that manner did not consist with
his views, which were principally two; the first to gratify his hungry adventurers
with lands, the next to subvert the English law, and introduce
the feudal and Norman policy in lieu of it<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.</p>

<p>The first step he made there was no finding fault with. It was now allowed,
that William’s title was legal from the beginning, and that Harold
was an usurper, and all that adhered to him rebels. He made enquiry for
all the great men that fell in battle on Harold’s side. Their lands he
confiscated, and distributed, upon the terms of the Norman law, to his followers;
but these were not half sufficient to satisfy the expectants, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
English were still too powerful, as he had pardoned all those who survived.
He therefore returned to Normandy, carrying Edgar and the chief of the
English nobility with him, under pretence of doing them honour, but in
reality, that they might be absent while his views were carrying on; and in
the mean time he left his scheme to be executed by his Normans, and those
he had appointed his regents. I say <i>his</i> scheme, for his interest, to exalt
one side and depress the other, on which he could not depend, almost
forced him to this conduct. The oppressions, therefore, were so exorbitant
in his absence, as must necessarily have driven a people to rebel, and for
which a man of justice would think the real delinquents ought to be the
persons punished, whilst the unhappy nation merited the freest pardon, for
whatever they did when actuated by a despair, proceeding from the denial
of justice. But that he himself was the immediate source of these distresses
is evident from his temper, which was such, that no regents of his durst
have acted as they did without his approbation. The Normans began by
encroaching on their neighbours the English, nay with forcibly turning
them out of their entire possessions. If these applied to the regents in the
<i>curia regis</i>, there was no redress. If they retaliated the injuries they suffered,
they were declared outlaws and rebels<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.</p>

<p>These proceedings threw the whole nation into a flame, and, had they
had a leader of sufficient weight and abilities to head them, William,
perhaps, might have been dethroned; but the right heir, and all the men
he feared, were out of the kingdom. They produced, therefore, only ill-concerted,
unconnected insurrections, headed by men of no considerable
figure, provoked by private wrongs; and these being easily suppressed, afforded
a fund of new confiscations, which he disposed of in the same manner
as the former, and thereby spread the use of the feudal law further into
several parts of England. However, though he did not spare the insurgents,
nor punish his officers that had occasioned those commotions, he did
not, as some have asserted, seize all the lands of England as his by right of
conquest; for, when he came over, his court was open to the complaints of
the English, and if any of them could undeniably prove, as indeed few of
them could, that they had never assisted Harold, or been concerned in the
late disturbances, they were restored to their lands as they held them before;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
as appears from the case of Edwin Sharrburn, and many others. By
these means William obtained the first of his great ends, the transferring almost
all the lands of England to his followers, and making them inheritances,
descendible according to the Norman law.</p>

<p>But as to the inheritances that still remained in English hands, had he not
proceeded somewhat farther, they would have gone in the old course, and
been free from the burthen of feudal tenure. But how to alter this, and
to subject the few allodial lands, as also the church lands, to the Norman
services, was the question; for he had sworn to observe Edward’s laws.
The alteration, therefore, must be made by the <i>commune concilium</i>, or parliament,
and this he was not in the least danger of not carrying, in a house
composed of his own countrymen, enriched by his bounty, and who were
born and bred under the law he had a mind to introduce; and who could
not be well pleased to see some of the conquered nation enjoy estates on
better terms than themselves the conquerors. The pretence of calling this
assembly, which was convened in the fourth year of his reign, was very
plausible. The English had grievously and justly complained of the constant
violation of the Saxon laws, and the only extenuation that could be
made for this, and which had some foundation in truth, was, that the king
and his officers were strangers, and not acquainted with that law. He therefore
summoned this <i>commune concilium</i>, or parliament, to ascertain what the
antient law was, and to make such amendments thereto, as the late change
and circumstances of affairs required. And, for their instruction in the old
law, which was but partly in writing, most of it customary, he summoned
twelve men, the most knowing in the laws of England, out of each county,
to assist and inform them what those laws were.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find the laws of William the First are, in general, little
other than transcripts of the Saxon laws or customs. However, there
are two, which were intended to alter the military policy of the kingdom,
to abolish the <i>trinoda necessitas</i>, and in its lieu, to make the lands of the English,
and of the church liable to knights service, as the Normans lands were
by his new grants, and thereby make the system uniform. His fifty second
law is entirely in feudal terms, and was certainly drawn up by some person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
skilled in that law, for the purpose I have mentioned. It runs thus: <i>Statuimus
ut omnes liberi homines fædere &amp; sacramento affirment, quod intra et
extra universum regnum angliæ, Willielmo Domino suo fideles esse volunt, terras
&amp; honores illius ubique servare cum eo, &amp; contra inimicos &amp; alienigenas defendere</i><a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall make a few remarks on the wording of this law; and first on
the word <i>statuimus</i>. Wright<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> observes, that it being plural, implies that
this was not by the king alone, but by the <i>commune concilium</i>, or parliament,
for the stile of the king of England, when speaking of himself was for
ages after in the singular number, and in the subsequent part he is plainly
distinguished from the enactors of the law; for it is not <i>mihi</i>, or <i>nobis fideles
esse</i>, but <i>Willielmo Domino suo</i> in the third person, nor, <i>terras &amp; honores
meos</i> or <i>nostros servare</i>, but <i>terras &amp; honores illius</i>; and indeed, in the subsequent
law I shall mention it is expressly said in effect, that the subjecting
the free lands to knight service was <i>per commune concilium</i>. Secondly, the
words <i>liberi homines</i> is a term of the feudal law, properly applicable to allodial
tenants, who held their lands free from the military service that vassals
were obliged to: And in this sense was it used in France also, from whence
William came. In these words were included also, the men of the church,
for as their lands were before subject to the <i>trinoda necessitas</i>, it was reasonable
when that was abolished, they should be subject to this that came in the
lieu of it. <i>Fædere</i> and <i>sacramento affirment</i>. <i>Fædus</i> is the homage, which,
though done by the tenant only to the lord, was looked upon by the feudists
as a contract, and equally bound both parties, as is <i>sacramentum</i>; as
appears after the feudal oath of fealty; and they are placed in the order
they are to be done, homage first and then the oath of fealty. <i>Willielmo
Domino suo</i>, not <i>regi</i>, not the oath of allegiance as king, but the oath of
fealty from a tenant to a landlord, for the lands he holds. <i>Fidelis</i> is the
very technical word of the feudal law for a vassal. But the words <i>intra &amp;
extra universum regnum angliæ</i> are particularly to be observed: For these
made a deviation from the general principles of the feudal law, and one
highly advantageous to the kingly power. By the feudal law no vassal was
obliged to serve his lord in war, unless it was a defensive war, or one he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
thought a just one, nor for any foreign territories belonging to his lord,
that was not a part of the seignory of which he held; but this would not
effectually serve for the defence of William. He was duke of Normandy,
which he held from France, and he knew the king of that country was
very jealous of the extraordinary accession of power he had gained by his
new territorial acquisition, and would take every occasion, just or unjust, of
attacking him there; in short, that he must be almost always in a state of
war. Such an obligation on his tenants, of serving every where, was of
the highest consequence for him to obtain; nor was it difficult, as most
of them had also estates in Normandy, and were by self-interest engaged in
its defence.</p>

<p>The next law of his I shall mention is the fifty-eighth, which enjoins all
who held lands by military service, and some others, to be in perpetual readiness.
It runs to this effect: “We enact and firmly command, that all
earls and barons and knights and servants, <i>servientes</i>, (that is the lower
soldiers, not knighted, who had not yet got lands, but were quartered
on the abbeys,) and all the freemen, (namely the Saxon freeholders, and
of the tenants of the church, which now was subjected to knights service) of
our whole aforesaid kingdom, shall have and keep themselves well in
arms, and in horses, as is fitting, and their duty; and that they should be
always ready, and well prepared to fulfil and to act whensoever occasion
shall be, according to what they ought by law to do for us from their
fiefs and tenements; and as we have enacted to them by the <i>commune
concilium</i> of our whole kingdom aforesaid; and have given and granted
to them in fee in hereditary right.” The great effect of this law was to
settle two things, not expressly mentioned in the former; the first to shew
the nature of the service now required, knight service on horseback; and
the other, to ascertain to all his tenants, Saxons as well as Normans, the
hereditary right they had in their lands, for if that had not been done by this
law, as now all lands were made feudal, and their titles to them consequently
to be decided by that law, they might otherwise be liable to a construction,
according to its principles, that any man, who could not shew in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
title <i>words of inheritance</i>, which the Saxons generally could not, was but tenant
for life<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

<p>This general law then put all on the same footing, and gave them inheritances,
as they had before, but of another nature, the feudal one, and consequently,
made them subject to all its regulations. From this time, and in
consequence of these laws, the maxim prevailed, that <i>all lands in England are
held from the king</i>, and that they all proceeded from his free bounty, as is
strongly implied in the word <i>concessimus</i>; and hence some, indeed many,
have imagined that the conqueror seized all the lands of England, as his by
right of conquest, and distributed them to whom, and on what terms he
pleased. With respect to the greater part, which he gave to his Normans,
this is true; but it appears from the records of his time, that it was not universally
the case. The laws I have mentioned so changed the nature of the
inheritances, which he did not seize, that they were subject to all the same
consequences, as if he had so done; though in truth, with respect to the
Saxons, he did not dispossess them. It was but a fiction in law.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that he made the lands of the church liable to knights
service, in lieu of the military expedition they were subject to before; but
this is to be understood with some limitation. For where the lands of an
ecclesiastical person, or corporation, were barely sufficient to maintain those
that did the duty, they, for necessity’s sake, were exempted; and the Saxon
expedition being abolished, the contribution thereto fell with it, and they
became tenants in <i>frankalmoine</i>, or <i>free alms</i>. But where an ecclesiastical
corporation was rich, and able, besides their necessary support, according
to their dignity, they were, by these laws, under the words <i>liberi homines</i>,
subjected to the new ordained military service, as they had been before to
the old, and according to their wealth, were obliged to find one or more
knights or horsemen. If they were obliged to furnish as many as a baron
regularly was, they were barons, as all the bishops and many of the great
abbots were; and, as barons, sat in the <i>commune concilium</i>; whereas, before,
the clergy in general sat in parliament, as well as the laity, not as a separate
body, nor invested with separate rights, but both clergy and laity
equally concurred in making laws, whether relative to temporal affairs or
spiritual; though, with respect to the latter, it may well be inferred, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
the ignorance of the times, that they had almost the entire influence. But
after this time the clergy became a separate body from the laity, had distinct
interests also, and a separate jurisdiction; nay, I may say, became, in
some degree, a separate branch of the legislature, by the right they claimed,
and exercised, of making canons to bind laity as well as clergy<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. But the
explaining this would carry me too far at present, so I shall defer it to my
next lecture.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I shall just recapitulate the prodigious alteration, as to
the properties of landed estates in England, introduced by the two laws of
the conquerors, I have mentioned, from what was their nature and qualities
before that time. They had been the absolute proprieties of the owner, (I
speak in general,) they could be aliened at pleasure, they could be devised
by will, were subject to no exactions on the death of the owner, but a very
moderate settled herriot paid by the executor. In the mean time, on the
death of the ancestor, the heir entered without waiting for the approbation
of the lord, or paying any thing for it; and his heir, if there was no will,
was all the sons jointly. No wardship, or marriage, was due or exacted, if
the heir was a minor. All these, by the feudal customs being introduced,
were quite altered. Lands could no longer be aliened without the consent
of the lord. No will or testament concerning them availed any thing. The
heir had no longer a right to enter into his ancestor’s inheritance immediately
on his death, until he (not the executor) had paid a relief (and that not
a moderate one) and been admitted by the lord. The heir, likewise, was
not all the sons jointly, but one, first, such as the lord pleased to prefer; at
length it became settled universally in favour of the eldest; and the fruits of
tenure, wardship, marriage and relief (for the Saxon herriot was, as I have
mentioned, a different thing) came in as necessary attendants of a feudal
donation.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that it has been said William introduced a new law,
the Norman one. He certainly did so as to landed estates; but this, as I
have observed before, by the consent of his parliament, who, being Normans,
were as well pleased with the change as himself; but it is not true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
with respect to the other old Saxon laws, which did not clash with the design
of introducing the military feudal system. Them he confirmed, and his
feudal laws were called only emendations. However, certain it is, his secret
design was to eradicate even the Saxon, the laws he had, in pursuance
of his coronation oath, confirmed, and that he took many steps thereto;
which though they had not the full effect he intended, wrought considerable
changes. What these were, and the consequences of them, shall be the
subject of the next lecture.</p>

courts decline—The introduction of the Norman language—The distinction
between courts of record, and not of record—The separation of the spiritual and
temporal courts—The consequences of this measure.</i></p>

</div>

<p>William, by altering the nature of land estates, and the conditions
upon which they were held, had proceeded a good way in his second
capital design, the introduction of the Norman, and the abolishing of
the Saxon law. And farther than that, it was not proper nor consistent
with his honour, who had sworn to Edward’s laws, to proceed openly.
However he formed a promising scheme for sapping and undermining the
Saxon law by degrees. First, he appointed all the judges of the <i>curia regis</i>,
from among the Normans, persons fond of their own law, ignorant of the
English, and therefore incapable, even if they had a mind, to judge according
to it.</p>

<p>Before his time this court only meddled with the causes of the great
lords, or others that were of great difficulty, but now it was thought proper
to discourage the county courts, and to introduce most causes originally into
the superior court; and for this there was a reasonable pretence, from the
divisions and factions between the two nations and the partialities that must
ever flow from such a situation of affairs. The ancient laws of England had
been written, some in the Saxon, some in the Latin tongue, and the laws of
William, and of many of his successors, were penned in the latter language.
But in the <i>curia regis</i> all the pleadings henceforward were entered in the
Norman tongue, the common language of his court, as were also, all the
proceedings therein, until the time of Edward the Third. This introduced
the technical law terms and with those came in the maxims and rules of
administering justice belonging to that people, which gradually, wherever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
they differed from, superseded the English. Hence proceeded the great
affinity I may say, identity, between the antient law of Normandy, as set
forth in the <i>coutumier</i> of that country, and the law of England, as it stood
soon after the conquest.</p>

<p>The analogy, however, did not arise from this alone. Though England
borrowed most from Normandy, yet, on the other hand, Normandy borrowed
much from England. William, for the ease of his people, who had occasion
to frequent his court, or had suits in the <i>curia regis</i>, established schools
for instructing persons in this language, and obliged parents of substance to
send their children thither, which had the consequence of abolishing the old
Saxon tongue, and forming a new language, from the mixture of both<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.</p>

<p>This introduction of a new language, together with the exaltation of the
<i>curia regis</i> and the consequent depression of the county courts, introduced,
as I apprehend, the distinction between the <i>courts of record</i>, and <i>not of record</i>,
and made the county courts considered of the latter kind. Courts of record
are such whose proceedings are duly entered, which, at that time, was
to have been done in the Norman tongue, and which proceedings are of
such weight, as, unless reversed, for ever appearing from the record, can
never be gainsaid or controverted. Now, to allow such a privilege to the
proceedings of the inferior courts, the county ones, where the suitors were
judges, and where, besides, the proceedings were in the English language,
would have been contrary to the policy of that time, and would have tended,
rather to the confirmation than depression of the old law. The spiritual
courts, also, are not allowed to be courts of record, and that, I presume,
because they were antiently a part of the county courts, and separated from
them, as I shall shew presently in this reign, and therefore could have no
greater privilege than the court from which they were derived. However
some inferior courts, such as the <i>tourn</i>, and the leet, were allowed to be
courts of record, and that, I conceive, both for the benefit of the realm,
and the profit of the king; for these were criminal courts, where public offences
were punished, and therefore should have all weight given them, and
where the king’s forfeitures and fines for crimes were found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>I have observed before, that the courts, in the Saxon times, were mixed
assemblies, where the bishop and sheriff presided, and mutually assisted each
other, and where the bishop, I may add, had a share in the amerciaments
and fines. But in this reign the spiritual and temporal courts were separated
by William, a thing which afterwards was of bad consequence to many
of his successors, but was, at the time, very serviceable to the views he then
had. This was certainly done partly to oblige the pope, who had espoused
his title, and at this time was setting up for the universal lord of churchmen,
though, in after times, they carried their pretensions much higher<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.</p>

<p>One great engine the popes set on foot to attain the power they aimed
at, was to make a distinction between <i>clergy</i> and <i>laity</i>, to have the matters
relating to the former, as well the merely spiritual as the temporal rights
they had acquired, cognizable only in their own jurisdictions; and, to preserve
the distinction stronger, to forbid their interfering in the temporal
courts, upon pretence of their time being taken up in spiritual exercises, and
particularly, that it suited not the piety and charity of a clergyman, even by
his presence, to countenance the proceeding to sentence of death, or the
mutilation of limbs. Many were the laws they made for this purpose, upon
motives of pretended piety; and the circumstances and practices of the
times contributed greatly to their success. The emperors, kings, and great
lords, had the nomination to bishoprics, and other benefices, as their ancestors
had been the founders, and their lands were held from them. But
shameful was the abuse they made of this power. Upon pretence of the
clergy being their beneficiary tenants, according to the principles of the feudal
law, they exacted reliefs, and arbitrary ones from them before investiture,
or, to speak in plain terms, they sold them on Simoniacal contracts to
the highest bidder, as the Conqueror’s son William did afterwards in England;
so that the profligate and vicious were advanced to the highest dignities,
while the conscientious clergy remained in obscurity; nay, if they
could get no clergyman to come up to their price, they made gifts of the
title and temporalities to laymen, nay, to children; it was a matter of little
concern that there was no one to do the spiritual office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>Such practices, (and they were too common) gave just and universal offence
to all sober persons, so that the popes were generally applauded for
their aiming at the reformation of the evils, and for the endeavouring, by
their decrees, to reform the morals of the corrupt clergy, and to restore an
elective manner of conferring benefices, though their real design was first to
become the protectors of the clergy, next, their lords and masters, and
then, by their means, to tyrannize over the laity; a plan which they carried
into execution with too much success. This plan was in the height of its
operation in William’s reign. The foundation of it had been laid before,
as I observed, in the many distinctions made between clergy and laity, and
the prohibiting the first, except some great ones, from meddling with secular
affairs, or tribunals. This reparation, however, had not yet taken place
in England, and it is not a wonder that William, who had peculiar views of
his own in it, as I shall observe, thought it reasonable to oblige his benefactor
the pope, and to conform the constitution of this church and nation
to that of France, where the clergy were a separate body.</p>

<p>The private views of the king were twofold, the first arose merely from
his personal character, his avarice. By the bishop’s ceasing to be a judge
in the temporal courts, he lost his share of the mulcts or fines imposed therein,
and in consequence the king’s two-thirds of them were encreased. But
his other view lay deeper. To comprehend this, we must remember how
great was the ignorance of those ages. Scarce a man, except a clergyman,
could read or write, insomuch that being able to read was looked upon as a
proof of being in orders. Many even of the greatest lords could not write
their names, but signed <i>marks</i>; and from this ignorance it was that proceeded
the great weight our law gives to <i>sealing</i> above <i>signing</i> any instrument,
and that sealing is what makes it a man’s deed. It followed from hence
that the laity must be grossly ignorant in point of the laws. Their knowledge
could extend no farther than as they remembered a few particular
cases, that fell under their own observation; whereas the clergy had the
benefit of reading the written laws, and consulting the proceedings thereon,
in the rolls of the courts of justice, and they were the only lawyers of the
times; insomuch that it became a proverb, <i>nullus clericus nisi causidicus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>What method then could so effectually answer the king’s end of making
the Saxon law fall into oblivion, which he could not openly abolish, after
having solemnly sworn to observe it, as the removing from the courts of
justice those persons who only knew it, and could oppose any innovation his
Norman ministers should attempt to introduce. This policy, however, as
artfully as it was laid, had not its full effect; for many of the clergy, unwilling
to lose so gainful a trade, appeared still in these courts in disguise,
as laymen, and at this time it is very probably conjectured that that ornament
of the serjeant at law’s dress, the <i>coiff</i>, was introduced, and for this very purpose
of hiding the tonsure, which would have shewn them to be clerks.
This their attendance, in some degree, frustrated the scheme, and many of
the Saxon laws, such especially as were repeated in William’s, kept their
ground, but many more were forgotten.</p>

<p>I mentioned that one motive of William’s to separate the jurisdictions,
was to oblige the pope, to whose favour he owed much, yet it ought to be
observed to his honour, that he maintained the independency of his kingdom
with a royal firmness. Pope Gregory, commonly called Hildebrand,
who was the first that ventured so far as to excommunicate sovereign princes,
as he did the emperor no less than four different times, conceiving William
could not sit securely on his throne without the aid of his see, demanded of
him homage for the kingdom of England, and the arrears of Peter’s pence;
grounding his claim of superiority on his predecessor’s consecrated banner,
and that Peter-pence was the service by which the kingdom was held from
the holy see. But he found he had a man of spirit to deal with. William
allowed the justice of the demand of Peter-pence, and promised to have it
collected and paid, not as a tribute, but as a charitable foundation, as in
truth it was, to support a college of English students at Rome, for the benefit
of the English church. As to <i>homage</i>, he absolutely refused it, and
declared he held his crown from God alone, and would maintain its independence;
and to convince the pope he was in earnest, he issued an edict
forbidding, on their allegiance, his subjects to acknowledge any person for
sovereign pontiff, until he had first acknowledged him. So bold a step convinced
Gregory, who was already sufficiently embroiled with the emperor,
that this was no fit time to push things; and so he dropped his project, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
without retracting it; for the court of Rome never did in any case formally
recede from a pretension it had once advanced.</p>

<p>The consequences of the separation of the ecclesiastical from the temporal
jurisdiction were many. It naturally occasioned controversies concerning
the respective limits, and these gave rise to the <i>curia regis</i> interposing in
these matters, and, by prohibitions, preventing one from encroaching upon
the other. The great contest was concerning suits for benefices, or church
livings, which the clergy contended were of <i>spiritual</i>, and the king’s courts,
of <i>temporal</i> cognizance. And this, indeed, was the great question that, in
those days, divided the Christian world abroad. However in England, the
clergy were, at length, foiled in this point. But a much greater evil arose
from this separation. It is a maxim of all laws, that no man should be
twice punished for the same crime, and this just maxim the clergy, in favour
of the members of their own body, perverted in a shocking manner.
If a clerk committed murder, rape, or robbery, the bishop tried and condemned
him to penance; and this sentence was made a pretence of not delivering
him to the temporal courts, to be tried for his life. This was one
of the great disputes concerning the constitutions of Clarendon, in Henry
the Second’s time, between him and archbishop Becket<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>.</p>

<p>At length, about Henry the Third’s reign, the limits between the several
jurisdictions were pretty well settled, and by subsequent statutes, and judicial
resolutions, are confined to the respective limits they are now under.
Indeed, since the Reformation, as the credit of the canon law has declined,
on account of the dilatory proceedings, and the use of excommunication
upon every trifling contempt, the reputation of the ecclesiastical courts has
greatly fallen, and prohibitions are now issued, in many cases, where they
could not have been granted in former times. Yet, if we examine accurately,
we shall find that these great complaints, which, it must be owned, are
in the general just, namely, of dilatoriness and excommunications, proceeded
from the separation of the two courts by William. Before, when the
courts sat together, the sheriff assisted the bishop, and by his temporal power
compelled the parties to appear, and submit to the sentence, if they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
contumacious against excommunication. But when they were separated,
the bishop was left to his spiritual arms, merely, excommunication; and as
the consequences of such a sentence were, in the superstitious times, looked
on as very dreadful, and are really severe in law, several intermediate processes
and notices were necessary before they proceeded to that extremity;
and this gave opportunity to litigious persons to disobey every order the
court made in a cause, until they came to the brink of excommunication,
and that way, by repeated contumacies, to spin out causes to an unconscionable
length. And the want of other arms compelled these courts, on very
trifling contempts, to enforce their orders by excommunication, which, it
must be owned, according to its primitive and right use, should be reserved
only for flagitious immoralities<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.</p>

<p>Another evil consequence that flowed from this separation of these
courts, was, that the pope cunningly got his, the canon law, introduced into
the ecclesiastical courts, which made him the head of the church, introduced
appeals to him, and in effect, robbed the king of so many subjects in ecclesiastical
affairs, whereas, before, though there might be references in cases
of difficulty for advice to Rome, there were no appeals thither. The <i>curia
regis</i> was to reform ecclesiastical judgments, and the ecclesiastical, as well as
temporal jurisdiction, was the king’s.</p>

<p>Another evil consequence, and it is the last I shall mention, of this alteration,
was the setting up two legislatures, if I may say so, in the kingdom.
In the antient time all laws were made in the same assembly, but now, the
clergy being separated from the laity, when a parliament was called, the
business became divided; ecclesiastical matters, and the taxes on the clergy,
were handled in the convocation, as temporal matters, and the taxes on the
laity, were in parliament. This contributed to the further clashing of jurisdictions.
For it must be owned the convocation exceeded their powers, and
made canons about things merely temporal; which, however, they contended
to be spiritual; and sometimes contrary to the express law of the land,
nevertheless they by the superstitious and ignorant, who knew not the distinction
between such things, were generally obeyed, and hence from such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
submission it is, that, by custom, in several places, tythes are payable of things
that are not tythable at common law.</p>

<p>The right of the convocation’s canons binding the laity in spiritual matters
was never doubted in the times of popery, nay till Charles the First’s
time, if they had the approbation of the king, who was the head of the
church, it was the general opinion, except among the Puritans. But since
that time their jurisdiction is settled on a reasonable footing. Their canons
bind no man, spiritual or lay, in temporal matters. They bind no layman
in spiritual matters; but they bind the clergy in spiritual matters, provided
that no right of the laity is thereby infringed. As for instance, there is a
canon forbidding clergymen to celebrate marriage out of canonical hours.
This doth not bind even a clergyman, for if it did, it would strip the laity
of their right of being married at any hour. However it is to be considered
whether a canon of the convocation is a new ordinance, or only a repetition
of the old ecclesiastical law. If the latter, it binds all men, spiritual and lay,
not as a canon, but as the law of the land.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror left three sons, Robert, William and
Henry. The eldest, Robert, according to the established rules
of the French fiefs, succeeded in Normandy, and on account of his primogeniture
laid claim also to the crown of England; but what right that
gave him, might in those days, well be a question. In the Saxon times
the rule was to elect a king out of the royal family, and the election generally
fell on the eldest son, though not universally; for the line of Alfred
reigned in prejudice to the descendants of his two elder brothers. Edred
succeeded to his brother Edmund, in prejudice of Edmund’s two sons;
again, on Edred’s death, his son was excluded, and Edmund’s eldest son
resigned; and lastly Edward the Confessor was king, though his elder
brother’s son was living. So that priority of birth was rather a circumstance
influencing the people’s choice, than what gave an absolute right of
succession<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing, it might be pretended, should determine this point,
that is, as William claimed the crown through the will, as he said, of the
Confessor, he also had not a power to bequeath the crown. When, therefore,
he was making his will he was applied to on this head, but the approach
of death seems to make him acknowledge that his only just title was
his <i>election</i>, for though he hated his son Robert, and was extremely fond of
William, he refused to dispose of it by will. He only expressed his wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
that William might succeed, and dispatched him to England, with letters
to Lanfranc archbishop of Canterbury, requesting him to influence the
election in his favour, and he accordingly was crowned. Indeed, it seems
a little odd that William, whose bad qualities were universally known (for
he had not one single virtue, except personal bravery) should be preferred
to Robert, who, with that virtue, possessed all the amiable virtues of humanity.</p>

<p>That the native English should prefer any one to Robert is not to be
wondered at, as he had, on all occasions, expressed the highest aversion to
them, but they had no influence in the matter and it appears, at first
view, the interest of the English lords, most of whom had also estates in
Normandy, to be subject to one monarch, and not have their estates liable
to confiscation, on taking part with one of the brothers against the other.
But the interest of Lanfranc and the clergy, added to his father’s treasure,
which he had seized, and distributed liberally, bore down all opposition;
and indeed, it is probable that Robert’s disposition, which was well known,
operated in his disfavour; for his extreme indolence and prodigality, and
his scruples of using improper means for attaining the most desirable ends
(whereas William was extremely active and would stick at nothing) made
it easy for persons of any penetration to see in whose favour the contest
between the two brothers must end<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>.</p>

<p>We have little to say of the laws in his time, for he regarded no laws,
divine or human, ecclesiastical or temporal. He chose for judges and courtiers
the most profligate persons he could find. And one of the great oppressions
his people laboured under was the extending, and aggravating the
forest laws. The <i>forests</i> were large tracts of land, set apart by his father
for the king’s hunting out of the royal demesnes; and consequently William
his father had by his own authority, made laws, and severe ones, to
be observed in these districts for the preservation of the game, and erected
courts to try offenders, and trespassers in his forests. The great intention
of these courts was to fleece his subjects, who were as fond of hunting as
their sovereign, by mulcts and fines; and in truth, these were the only oppressions
his countrymen, the Normans, suffered under the Conqueror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>But Ruffus flew out of all bounds. He introduced the <i>lawing</i>, as it is
called, the Hamstringings of Dogs; nay, he made a law, by his own authority,
to make the killing of a deer capital. On pretence of this law he
seized many of the great and rich, confined them for years, without bringing
them to tryal, until he forced them to compound, and to give up the
better part of their estates. Not content with harrassing the laity, he laid
sacrilegious hands on the church revenues. Whenever a rich abbey, or
bishoprick, fell vacant, he laid his hands on the temporalities, kept them
vacant for years, as he did that of Canterbury four years; and even, when
he was prevailed upon to fill them, he openly set them to sale in his presence,
and gave them to the best bidder. However, in a violent fit of sickness,
he promised to reform, and did till he recovered his strength, when his reformation
vanished. The remonstrances of his clergy, or the pope, had
no effect with him; and, indeed, the circumstances of the times were favourable.
For as there were two popes, one made by the emperor, the
other, by the Romans, who disowned the imperial authority in that respect,
William acknowledged neither, and each was afraid to drive him into his
adversaries party, by proceeding to extremities.</p>

<p>These enormities raised him so many enemies among his subjects, of all
kinds, that Robert had a strong party, and an insurrection was begun in
his favour, which William, profiting of Robert’s indolence, easily suppressed,
and then invaded him in Normandy, and was near conquering it, as,
by a sum of money, he detached the king of France from the alliance, if
he had not been invaded by Scotland, in favour of Robert. He patched
up, therefore, a peace with him, ratified by the barons on both sides, the
terms of which were, that the adherents of each should be pardoned, and
restored to their estates, and the survivor succeed to the other<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus there was a legal settlement of the crown of England made, which
ought to have taken place, but did not. For William being accidentally
killed in hunting, while Robert was absent in Italy, on his return from the
holy war, Henry the youngest son, took the advantage, and seizing his
brother William’s treasure, was crowned the third day, after a very tumultuous
election, the populace threatening death to any that should oppose him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
The reason of their attachment to him was, that he was, by birth, an Englishman,
and therefore, they hoped for milder treatment from him than
they had met from his two Norman predecessors. Besides he had promised
a renewal of the Confessor’s laws, with such emendations as his father had
made. And in pursuance of this promise, as soon as he was crowned, he
issued a charter, containing the laws as he now settled them, and sent
copies of it to every cathedral in his kingdom.</p>

<p>These laws were, as to the bulk of them, the old Saxon constitutions,
with the addition of the Conqueror’s law of fiefs, and some things taken
from the compilations of the canon law. However, with respect to the
feudal law, he, in many instances, moderated its severity. With respect to
<i>reliefs</i>, he abolished the arbitrary and heavy ones which William had exacted,
and restored the moderate, and certain ones, which his father had
established. With respect to the <i>marriage</i> of his vassal’s children, he gave
their parents and relations free power of disposing of them, provided they
did not marry them to his enemies, for obviating which, his consent was
to be applied for, but then he expressly engaged not to take any thing for
his consent; and the <i>wardships</i> of his minor tenants he committed to their
nearest kindred, that they might take care of the persons and estates of the
ward, and account with him for the profits during the minority, upon reasonable
terms. He even, in some degree, restored the Saxon <i>law of descents</i>,
and permitted alienation of lands. For if a man had several fiefs,
and several sons, the eldest had the principal one, on which was the place
of habitation, only, and the rest went among the sons, as far as they
would go; and if a man purchased or acquired land (as land might be
alienated by the feudal law, with the consent of the superior lord,) such
acquisitions by the laws of Henry, he was not obliged to transmit to his
heirs; but might alien at pleasure<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.</p>

<p>This mitigation of the former law was very agreeable to his people,
both English and Normans. The former were pleased to see the Saxon law
so nearly restored, and the latter, harrassed with the oppressions of William,
were glad to have the heavy burthens of their tenures lightened; and indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
began, by degrees, to relish the old English law, and to prefer it to
their own.</p>

<p>To attach the bulk of his subjects to him still more strongly, he took another
very prudent step. He married Maud the daughter of the king of
Scotland, by Edgar Atheling’s sister, so that in his issue the blood of the
Norman and Saxon kings were united. But still he was not firmly settled,
until the affairs of the church, and the right of lay persons granting investitures
of church livings were settled. He intended to proceed in the same
manner that his father and brother had done. He accordingly named
persons to the vacant bishopricks, and recalled Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury,
who had lived in exile during the latter part of William’s reign,
on account of the then famous dispute of lay investitures. But Anselm,
adhering to the canons of a council held at Rome, refused to consecrate
the bishops named by the king, and also to do him homage for the temporalities
of his own see, which the king required before he gave him possession.</p>

<p>Henry, afraid of detaching from himself, and attaching to his brother
Robert, the pope and so powerful a body as the bulk of the clergy, with
so popular and high spirited a priest at their head, was obliged to propose
an expedient, that he should send ambassadors to the pope, to represent
that these canons were contrary to the antient law and customs of the nation,
and to endeavour to obtain a dispensation for not complying with the
canons; and that, in the mean time, Anselm might enter into the temporalities
of his see. This proposal was accepted. But, though, the king’s
desiring to do that by dispensation, which he had a right to do by law, was
tacitly giving up his cause, the pope knew his own strength, and Henry’s
weakness too well, to grant this favour. He insisted on the canons being
executed, which produced another quarrel between the king and archbishop.
The archbishop, attended by other bishops his adherents, went to
Rome to complain. The king sent new ambassadors, but all in vain. The
pope proceeded to threaten excommunication, which, in those days of superstition,
would have tumbled Henry from the throne, so he was obliged
to submit, and come to a composition. He renounced the nomination and
investiture <i>per annulum &amp; baculum</i>, restored the free election of bishops and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
abbots to the chapters and convents, which, as the pope was judge of the
validity of such elections, was, in effect, almost giving them to him; and, in
acknowledgment of his antient right of patronage, was allowed the custody
of the temporalities during the vacancy; was allowed to give the <i>congé
d’elire</i>, or license to proceed to election, without which they could not
elect, and was allowed to receive homage from the elect, upon the restitution
of the temporalities.</p>

<p>Thus the pope gratified the king with the shadow, and gained to himself
and the church the substance, and thus, at this time ended, that contest
in England, which had cost so many thousand lives abroad, between
the pope and emperors. Henry, however, retained a considerable influence
in the elections, for before he issued his <i>congé d’elire</i>, he generally
convened his nobles and prelates, and with them recommended a proper
person, who generally was chosen; and this the pope, for the present, suffered
to pass<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.</p>

<p>I have little else to observe touching the laws in this reign, save what
pertains to the <i>celibacy of the clergy</i>. The popes, aiming at detaching the
clergy entirely from secular interests, had made many canons against their
marrying, and all the eloquence of some centuries had been employed in
recommending celibacy. These canons, however, had not their full effect
in England; for very many of the secular clergy were still married. Anselm,
in a synod he assembled, enacted a canon against them, commanding
them to dismiss their wives, upon pain of suspension, and excommunication,
if they presumed to continue to officiate. Cardinal de Crema was
afterwards sent legate by the pope to England, where, in a general assembly
of the clergy, he re-enacted the canons against their marriages, and
presiding in a lofty throne, uttered a most furious declamation against such
a sinful practice, declaring it a horrid abomination, that priests should rise
from the arms of a strumpet, and consecrate the body of Christ. And
yet the historians assure us, that, after consecrating the eucharist in that assembly,
he was found that very night in the stews of Southwark, in bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
with a prostitute; which made him so ashamed, that he stole privately out
of England<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.</p>

<p>Henry, though he had subdued Normandy, and kept his brother Robert
in prison, was not without uneasiness as to the succession to his dominions;
for Robert’s son was an accomplished prince, and protected by the
king of France, whereas his own bore but a worthless character. However,
to secure the succession to him, he assembled the barons of Normandy in
Normandy, and those of England in England, and prevailed on them to
take the oath of allegiance to him as such. But he being soon after drowned,
the king, in hopes of male issue, took a second wife, and after three
years fruitless expectation, he turned his thoughts to making his daughter
Maud his heir, and did accordingly prevail on his nobility to take the
oath of allegiance to her as successor. But one of the steps he took for securing
the throne to her, in fact, defeated his scheme. He knew that a
woman had never yet sat on an European throne, that Spain, which was
the only nation that admitted persons to reign in the right of females, had
never suffered the female herself, but always set up her son, if he was of a
competent age; if not, her husband. As to the circumstances of his own
family, his grandson was an infant, and neither he nor his daughter had
confidence in her husband. He knew that this oath was taken against the
general bent of his people, and that little dependance could be had on it
when he was gone, so easy was it to get absolution. His chief dependance
was on the power and influence of his natural son Robert, who, indeed,
did not disappoint him, and of his nephew Stephen, and of his brother Roger,
bishop of Salisbury, on all of whom he heaped wealth and honours.</p>

<p>Stephen, thus advanced, began to lift his eyes to the crown. He, as
well as his cousin Maud, was a grandchild of the Conqueror, and descended
from the Saxon kings; and he had the personal advantage of being a male,
and bearing an extraordinary good character. By his ability and generosity
he had become exceedingly popular, and his brother Roger secured the
clergy in his interest. Immediately on his uncle’s death, he seized his treasure,
which he employed as Henry had done William’s, and having spread
a report that Henry, on his death bed, had disinherited Maud, and made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
him his heir, he was crowned in a very thin assembly of barons. Sensible
of his weakness, he immediately convoked a parliament at Oxford, where,
of his own motion, he swore, not only to rule with equity, but that he
would not retain vacant benefices long in his hands, that he would sue
none for trespassing in his forests, that he would disforest all such as had
been made by the late king, and abolish the odious tax of <i>Danegelt</i>; concessions,
which, with the pope’s approbation of his title, so satisfied the
people, that all the lords and prelates who favoured Maud, and had kept
aloof, and among them Robert her brother, came in, and swore allegiance to
him as long as he kept these engagements; from which conditional oath they
expected he would soon release them, and indeed they did all they could
to provoke him to it. This bait taking, and he having disobliged his brother
and the clergy, Maud’s friends rose in her favour; and made the
kingdom for many years a field of blood<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>.</p>

<p>In one of these battles Stephen was taken, and Maud was universally acknowledged;
but her insufferable haughtiness, her inflexible severity to her
captive, and her haughty refusal of the city of London’s request, to mitigate
her father’s laws, and restore the Saxon, so alienated the people from
her, that she was forced to fly from London, and arms were again taken
up for Stephen. Her brother, who was the soul of her cause, being soon
after taken prisoner, was exchanged for Stephen, and he dying soon after,
Maud was forced to leave the kingdom to her competitor. However, Stephen
continuing still embroiled with the clergy, her son Henry, in a few
years after, invaded England, and was joined by multitudes; but some
noblemen, who loved their country, mediated a peace, and at last established
it on the following terms; that Stephen should reign during life; that
Henry should succeed him, and receive hostages at the present for the delivery
of the king’s castles to him on Stephen’s death; and that, in the interim,
he should be consulted with on all the great affairs of the kingdom;
and this agreement was ratified by the oaths of all the nobility of both sides.
In this treaty no mention was made of Maud’s title, though she was living<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon Stephen’s death, Henry the Second succeeded, according to the
settlement of the crown before made, and came to the possession of the
kingdom with greater advantages than most kings ever did. He was in
the flower of youth, had an agreeable person, and had already given the
most convincing proofs both of wisdom and valour. He was by far the
most powerful prince of his time: For, besides England, which when united
to its king in affection, was, by the greatness of its royal demesnes,
and the number of knights fees, incomparably the mightiest state in Europe,
in proportion to its extent; he had in France, where he was but a
vassal, greater territories than the king of France himself. In him were
united three great fees, to each of which belonged several great dependancies;
Anjou, which came from his father; Normandy from his mother,
and Guienne by his wife. And, from the very first steps he took on coming
to the throne, his subjects had good foundation to hope that this great
power would be principally exerted to make them happy. The whole
reign of Stephen, until the last pacification, had been a scene of dismal
confusion, in which every lord of a castle tyrannized at pleasure, during
the competition for the crown; and though, from the time of the settlement
of peace, Stephen published edicts to restrain violence and rapine,
and made a progress through the kingdom, in order to re-establish justice
and order, he lived not long enough to see his good intentions answered,
but left the work to be accomplished by his successor.</p>

<p>The first thing Henry did was to discharge a multitude of foreigners,
whom Stephen kept in arms during his whole reign. His next care was
the reformation of the coin, which had been greatly debased. He coined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
money of the due weight and fineness, and then cried down the adulterated
which had, in the late reign, been counterfeited by the Jews, and the many
petty tyrants in their castles. These to humble, and make amesnable
to law, was his next concern. As to the castles in private hands, that had
been erected in his grandfather’s time, or before, he meddled not with
them; but all that had been built during Stephen’s reign, either by permission
or connivance, through the weakness of that prince, which were
the great nuisances, he issued a proclamation for demolishing, except some
few, which, from their convenient situation, he chose to keep in his own
hands, for the defence of the realm. And, lastly, as the crown had been
greatly impoverished by the alienations Stephen had, through necessity,
been forced to make, he issued another, to renounce all the antient demesnes
that had been so alienated, that he might be enabled to support his dignity
without loading his people, except on extraordinary occasions<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>.</p>

<p>These reformations, however just in themselves, or agreeable to the
subject, he did not proceed on merely by his own authority. He had deliberated
with the nobles, who attended at his coronation, concerning them,
and had their approbation; and though there were no acts of parliament
made at that time, yet, as form in those days was less minded than substance,
these edicts had the obedience of laws immediately paid them by all,
except some mutinous noblemen, who still held their castles in a state of
defence. Having taken these prudent steps, he formed his privy council
of the best and wisest men of the nation, and by their advice summoned a
regular parliament, wherein many good regulations were made. The laws
of the Confessor, as amended by Henry the First, were re-established, and
every thing, both in church and state, settled on the footing they were in
the time of that king. Being thus armed with a full parliamentary authority,
he marched against his mutinous nobles, whom he soon brought to
submit; and demolished their castles.</p>

<p>In another parliament, in order to settle the succession, contests about
which had had fatal effects ever since the death of the Conqueror, he prevailed
on his subjects to take the oath of allegiance, to his two sons, though
both in their infancy, first to William, then, to Henry, as his successors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
And having taken all these wise and just measures, for the peace and security
of his kingdom, he repaired to his foreign dominions; but his transactions
there, or even at home, that do not relate to the laws or constitution,
are not within the compass of the design of these lectures. Let it suffice
to say, that he made as good laws for, and was as good a sovereign to,
his French as his English subjects.</p>

<p>In his reign many were the alterations introduced into the English law,
most of them, no doubt, by act of parliament, though the records of them
are lost. For, in the beginning of his reign, as I observed, he enacted in
parliament the laws of Henry the First; and yet from the book of Glanville,
written in the latter end of his reign, it is plain there were great
changes, and the law was very much brought back to what it was in the
Conqueror’s reign; nay, in one respect, to what it was in Rufus’s, I mean
reliefs, the law of which I shall mention hereafter. Many likewise were the
regulations he introduced of his own authority, which in the event proved
very beneficial to his subjects.</p>

<p>The first I shall take notice of was his commutation of the services due
of his tenants in demesne, which formerly were paid in provisions and other
necessaries, into a certain sum of money, adequate to the then usual price.
His grandfather Henry did somewhat of this kind, but he it was that established
and fixed it; and his example was followed by his lords, so that,
from this time, rents became generally paid in certain yearly sums of money,
instead of corn and provisions. What advantage the successors of
these socage tenants gained thereby will be evident, if we consider the price
of things at or about that time. In the reign of Henry the First, we are
told, the current price of several commodities, which, however, must be
trebled when reduced to the money of our standard, were as follows: That
of a fat ox five shillings, of our money fifteen; a wether four-pence, of
ours, a shilling; wheat to serve an hundred men with bread for one meal,
a shilling, of ours, three shillings; a ration for twenty horses for a day,
four-pence, of our money a shilling. And although we should allow that,
in Henry the Second’s time, the prices of things were even doubled, which
is impossible to be admitted, it is easy to see how greatly the future socage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
tenants paying the same nominal rent, the value of which was daily decreasing,
rose in wealth and importance. Besides, they were greatly eased in
point of the expence and trouble of carrying the provisions to the king’s
court, to which before they were obliged, wherever he resided in England;
whereas, now, they had only to carry, or send by a proper messenger, the
money to be accepted as an equivalent<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.</p>

<p>His military tenants he eased in a much more considerable manner. By
the law of the Conqueror, every military man was obliged to serve at his
own expence forty days as well abroad, where the king’s occasions required,
as in England, and in person too, unless notoriously incapable; in which
case they were obliged to find each a deputy, and if they failed herein, by
the strictness of the feudal law, they forfeited their lands, or rather, as the
law was used in England, compounded at the king’s pleasure; which, if he
was very avaricious, came pretty near the same thing. This was a miserable
heavy grievance. For what oppression must it be for a knight of Northumberland,
who had, perhaps, but a single fee, to transport himself, it
may be, to Guienne, to serve forty days, and then return? Nay, it was inconvenient
to the king himself; for as France, where the scene of the king
of England’s wars generally lay, was every where full of fortifications, it
was scarce possible to finish a war in forty days, however great the humour
of that age was for pitched battles; the consequence of which was, that,
after that time, the king was ever in danger of being left in the midst of a
campaign, with an inferior army.</p>

<p>Henry then, sensible of these inconveniencies, both to himself and his
subjects, devised <i>escuage</i>, or <i>scutage</i>, in the fourth year of his reign, upon
account of his war with Toulouse upon which his wife had some pretensions.
He, knowing that this war required but a small part of his force, did,
both in Normandy and England, publish, that such of his military tenants
as would before-hand pay a certain sum of money, should be excused from
serving, either in person or by deputy; and this sum, which was rated by
him extremely moderately, and was, therefore, generally paid by his vassals,
rather than serve in so remote a place, he employed in hiring mercenary
soldiers of fortune, of whom there was plenty on the continent; and those,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
by their engagement, were obliged to serve during the continuance of the
war<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.</p>

<p>That his sole view, in this new project, was the ease of his people, and
the better prosecution of his wars, and not the depressing the military spirit
of his subjects, appears from hence; that those who were qualified, and
chose to serve in person, he caressed, and encouraged by all means possible;
that he never brought a single mercenary into England, when he had wars
with Wales or Scotland, but insisted on his subjects personal service; nay,
that he never kept those mercenaries on foot in his foreign dominions, but
dismissed them as soon as the war was at an end. And this of <i>scutage</i> was
the general method he followed in his subsequent wars in France and Ireland.
What wonder is it then, that this prince was universally beloved by
his people of all ranks? though, as the best institutions are liable to be corrupted,
this very scutage, that he devised for public ease, was turned into an
heavy engine of oppression by his son John.</p>

<p>Another alteration in the law in the reign of this king, was the point
<i>of reliefs</i>, as I mentioned before. The old relief of William the First, which
was restored by Henry the First, was certain, to all lords and knights, according
to their degrees, and was paid in horses and arms; but now the humour
of the times being that every thing should be paid in money, the relief
of a knight’s fee was settled at one hundred shillings, the fourth part of
its then computed yearly value, and which I suppose was about the price of
the armour, a knight was before to pay; and henceforward the arms of the
deceased descended to the heir, and consequently the coats of arms blazoned
thereon became hereditary. But the reliefs of barons, or earls, were not
settled at this time, but remained arbitrary, as Glanville informs us. <i>De baroniis
&amp; comitatibus nihil certum est statutum, quia juxta voluntatem et misericordiam
domini regis solent baroniæ capitales de releviis suis domino regi satisfacere<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>.</i></p>

<p>From the word <i>statutum</i> I take it for granted this change of reliefs into
money was by act of parliament. Indeed, how could it be otherwise; but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
then, the most surprising circumstance is, that the great lords, who, in that
age principally composed the parliament, should take care in this material
point, of the knights, the lower military tenants, and leave themselves at the
mercy of the crown. I shall venture on conjecture to assign the reason.
The Conqueror settled the reliefs of earls and barons at a certainty, because
he had fixed the number of knights fees they should contain; twenty to an
earldom, and thirteen and two-thirds to a barony; but by the time of Henry
the Second, the number of knights fees contained in them might be
greater or less. For instance, if an earl died, and left two daughters, his
twenty fees would be divided equally between them; but the dignity was
to go to the husband of that daughter the king chose. Now it would be
hard that he should pay for ten knights fees, merely because he had the
same title, as much as the predecessor paid for twenty. Again, in the new
created honours, it seems very probable, from many circumstances, that
an earldom might be erected but with fifteen knights fees, or, perhaps, with
twenty-five. The certainty of the <i>quantum</i> of land an earldom or barony
should consist of not being settled, I imagine, was the reason that the <i>quantum</i>
of relief was not expressly determined, though, by fixing that of a
knight’s fee, the reasonable relief might, in any case be easily determined.
And that Henry, and his son Richard exercised that discretion the law left
in them in this equitable manner, we may infer from there being no complaints,
as to reliefs, from the earls or barons, during their reigns; but
John revived the arbitrary relief of William Rufus, to the great oppression
of his nobles, until he was restrained by <i>Magna Charta</i>.</p>

<p>To no other reign than this, I think, can be ascribed, so properly, the
invention of <i>assizes of novel disseisin</i>, and the other <i>assizes</i>, for obtaining possession
of lands. By the strictness of the very antient feudal law, if a man
had been disseized, that is, turned out of possession, if he did not enter, and
regain his possession, or, at least, claim it within a year and a day, he lost
all right; for, if he was a socage tenant, the possessor had, within that time,
paid a rent to his lord, and been by him, who was supposed the best judge,
allowed to be the rightful tenant; and, if he was a military one, it was probable,
in those ages of perpetual war, he had actually served, at least he had
kept himself in constant readiness if called upon. But the limitation of a
year and day being soon found too short, it was after extended to five years;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
then, to the time of the possession of the disseizor himself, namely till he had
either died or aliened it. But upon the alienée, or heir of the disseizor, he
could not enter, because they came in honestly, by a fair title, and were
guilty of no wrong. However, this antient law, that gave no remedy but
by entry, during the seizor’s possession, was still too severe; for the <i>disseizor</i>
might alien, or die suddenly, before the <i>disseizee</i> could enter, or he might
hold the possession <i>manu forti</i>, so that the disseizee might not be strong
enough to enter and recover his possession<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>.</p>

<p>To remedy these evils, and to prevent bloodshed, the law provided for
the disseizee his right of action, either against the disseizor himself, or his
heir or assigns, and, in which, upon shewing his right to the land, he should
be restored to his possession by the king’s officer, the sheriff, with the <i>posse</i> of
the county. But still this action was hitherto but the <i>writ of right</i>, which
meddled not with the unlawful possession, only with the absolute right to the
land, and this action, if brought in the <i>curia regis</i>, where only impartial
justice could be expected; was very dilatory. It was dangerous also, as the
tenant in possession might offer battle. In this reign, then, were these <i>possessory
actions</i> introduced, for the determining the point of possession, leaving
the right of propriety as it was. It was advantageous likewise to the subject,
both disseizor and disseizee, as it gave him two trials for his lands; for
the writ of right when once determined was final and conclusive<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>.</p>

<p>This distinction between the <i>right of possession</i>, and the <i>right of propriety</i>
was borrowed from the civil law, which was first introduced in the late
reign, and was now, and for some time forward, studied with great assiduity
by the English, as appears from the many long transcripts from it to be
found in the books of our antient lawyers. There they found the distinction
of <i>actions possessory</i> and <i>petitory</i>; <i>possessory</i> when a man had been notoriously
in possession, and reputed the owner, and was put out by another of his
own authority. The public peace was concerned to protect the possession
of the reputed owner, and not to let him suffer the loss thereof while he
was suing his petitory action, that is on the mere right, which the other undoubtedly
would delay, by all the arts and shifts he could invent. The proceedings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
therefore, in possessory actions were summary and expeditious;
for they only regarded the possession, and did not determine the absolute
right: so there was no conclusive wrong done to either party, let the matter
of possession be decided how it would; for he that failed might bring his
petitory action for the right.</p>

<p>An <i>assize</i> in our law was a very summary action. Bracton, who lived an
hundred years after, calls it <i>novum &amp; festinum remedium</i>, and indeed so <i>festinum</i>
was it, that, in its proceedings, it seems to depart from the general rules
of reason and all laws. For it is a maxim of all laws, except in some few
very extraordinary cases, that no proofs are to be taken till an <i>issue</i> is <i>joined</i>,
as our law calls it, or till there is a <i>contest</i>, as the civil law expresseth it; that
is, till it is settled what is the matter to be proved, or till there is something
affirmed on one side, and denied on the other, upon which the merits
of the cause turn. If there be no disagreement about <i>facts</i>, but the question
is mere <i>matter of law</i>, the judges, who are best acquainted therewith,
are, by our law to determine. If the question be matters of fact, or facts
mixed with law, the jury, assisted with the judges, are to determine; though
if they doubt about the point of law, they may find the facts specially, and
leave the law arising thereon to the judges, which is what we call a <i>special
verdict</i>. No jury, therefore, ought to have been summoned till the defendant
appeared, and issue was joined, so that it was known what was the matter
to be tried; and this is the general rule. But, for the speedy settling
and quitting possessions, the assize is an exception thereto, as appears from
the <i>writ of assize</i> directed to the sheriff. For, besides giving notice to the
defendant, or <i>tenant</i>, as he is called in this action (because he is in possession)
the sheriff is immediately to summon a jury or assize, as it is called upon
this occasion, who shall directly go to the place, and make themselves
judges, by their view, of the nature, quality, and quantity of the land, or
thing demanded, and inform themselves, by all the ways they best may, of
the former possession of the demandant, and how he came to lose it. They
are then to appear the same day with the demandant and tenant, and, when
issue is joined between them, are to determine the matter according to their
own prior knowledge, and the evidence then given before them. I observed
that this action is not final. A brings an assize against B. If judgment
be given for A, B may bring his <i>writ of right</i>, if he has the right of propriety,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
and recover, and so <i>e contra</i>. But though B cannot deny his disseizing
A, he may still defend himself. The words of the writ are <i>injuste, &amp; sine
judicio, disseizivit</i>. He may therefore shew that he disseized A, justly, that
is, that he had a right of entry. As, suppose B was first in possession, A
disseizes him; then B, as he lawfully may, disseizes A, A shall not recover.
But if B had been in possession, and A’s father had disseized him, and died,
so that the land has come to A, who is innocent, B, not entering in the father’s
life-time, has lost his right of possession. It is so in A. Now if B disseizes
A, the son, though he had ever so good a right to the land, A shall
recover the possession; for B had no right to enter, though he had a right
to recover the possession he was deprived of by A’s father, by bringing an
action. Wherever a man comes innocently to a possession, the law will defend
that possession, until it is proved that he hath no good right to it<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.</p>

<p><i>The institution of Judges itinerant, or Justices in Eyre—The advantages attending
it—The jurisdiction of these Judges—Their circuits—The present
form of transacting the county business—The division of the Curia Regis into
four courts—The jurisdiction of the court of King’s Bench.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The greatest and most beneficial step taken by Henry the Second, was
the institution of <i>judges itinerant</i>, or <i>justices in eyre</i>, as they were called,
from the Norman word <i>eyre</i>, equivalent to, and derived from the Latin
<i>iter</i>. I observed before, that almost all businesses relative to the administration
of justice were, in the Saxon times, transacted in the county, and hundred,
that the leet and manor courts were held in the county, near the suitors
doors, and that none but the causes of the great lords, or such as were
of difficulty, were handled in the <i>curia regis</i>. Under the reign of the Conqueror,
I took notice, that the administration of other causes was facilitated
in the king’s great court, and that, consequently, the business of the inferior
courts began to decay; and I laid open the motives William had for that
conduct, the introduction of the Norman, and suppression of the Saxon law.
But the scheme succeeded in the same manner as his other one did, of rooting
out the English language, and introducing his own in lieu thereof. As
<i>this</i> produced a new language, from the mixture of both, so <i>that</i> caused the
English law to consist henceforward partly of feudal, partly of old Saxon
customs. However, the causes of most persons were still determined in the
inferior courts; for they were but few who were able to undergo the trouble
and expence of suing in the <i>curia regis</i>, especially, as all persons, whose causes
did not properly belong to the cognizance of that court, were obliged to
pay a fine for declining the proper jurisdiction, and for having licence to plead
in the superior<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.</p>

<p>But by this time the decisions of those courts, where the freeholders
were judges both of law and fact, had fallen into great and just disrepute,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
had occasioned many mischiefs, and were likely to produce many more. The
reasons, as they are delivered by lord Hale, were principally three: First,
the ignorance of the judges in the law: for as the freeholders in general
were Saxons, they must be supposed to be entirely ignorant of the feudal
law, which was now introduced with respect to titles in lands; or, if they
did know any thing of it, it is not probable that they would prefer that to
their own customs. Nay, the Norman freeholders could be of little service
in this point, considering their illiteracy, their education being confined
solely to arms, as also their frequent absence almost every year to attend
their lords in war. With respect to the Saxon law also, it could be little
expected that it should be regularly observed, now that the clergy, who only
were acquainted with it, were removed, and none of the judges could possibly
know more than an illiterate juryman at this day, who could neither
read nor write, might be able to pick up by attending a court held once a
month. How inadequate such a knowledge would be, even in those times,
when the laws were comparatively few, need not be enlarged on<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>.</p>

<p>It is true, some remedies were applied to obviate the bad consequences
of this ignorance; but they were very ineffectual. It was required that the
sheriff, who presided, should have some skill in the laws, but notwithstanding,
he was seldom found to have any; and if he had, it was not very probable,
as he was a Norman, that the jury would pay much regard to his direction
in giving their verdicts. As a further remedy to this ignorance, by
the laws of Henry the First, the bishop, the barons, and the great men of the
court, that is, the king’s immediate tenants, were ordered to attend. But
the bishop, in obedience to the canons, applied himself solely to his ecclesiastical
jurisdiction; and the others were generally in the king’s service; so
that they could but seldom attend, and if they did, they could do but little
service, being almost all bred to nothing but the sword, and as illiterate as
any other set of men.</p>

<p>The next mischief, and which flowed from the former, was, that this bred
great variety of laws in the several counties, whereas the intention of the
Confessor in his compilation, and of his successors afterwards in theirs, was
to have one uniform certain law, common to the whole kingdom. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
the decisions, or judgments, being made by divers courts, and by several
independent judges, who had no common interest, or communication together
touching the laws, in process of time, every several county was
found to have several laws, customs, rules, and forms of proceeding;
which is always the effect of several independent judicatories, administered
by several judges. And, indeed, this I look upon to be one of the great
causes of very many local customs in many parts of England, different
from, and derogatory to, the general common law.</p>

<p>But the third and greatest evil, was the frequent injustice of the judgments
given in those petty courts, and every business of any moment being
carried by parties and factions. The contest about the crown had been
carried on with such violence, that one half of the people, all over the
kingdom, were professed enemies to the other; and though both sides,
wearied with war, came into the expedient of Henry’s succession, and he
behaved so that there were no factions against him, yet as to individuals,
the sense of past injuries, and the rancour arising from thence, still remained.
For the freeholders being the judges, and these conversing with
one another, and those almost entirely of their own party; and being likewise
much under the influence of the lords, every one that had a suit there
sped according as he could make parties; and the men of great power and
interest in the county did easily overthrow others in their own causes, or
in such wherein they were interested, either by relation, tenure, service,
dependance, or application. True it is, the law provided a remedy for
false judgments given in these courts, by <i>a writ of false judgment</i> before the
king, or his chief justice; and in case the judgment, given in the county
court was found to be such, all the suitors were considerably amerced. Yet
this was insufficient for the purpose: For, first, it was too heavy and expensive
for many that were aggrieved; next, it was hard to amerce all for the
fault of a few, <i>viz.</i> the jury, who gave the verdict; and the amercement,
though sometimes very severe, being equally assessed, on all the freeholders,
was not a sufficient check upon the injustice of some juries<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.</p>

<p>The king therefore took a more effectual course; and, in his twenty-second
year, by advice of his parliament, held at Northampton, instituted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
<i>justices itinerant</i>. He divided the kingdom into six circuits, and to every
circuit allotted three judges, men knowing and experienced in the laws of
the realm, to preside in such cases as were of consequence, and to direct
the juries in all matters of law. They were principally empowered to try
<i>assizes</i>, that is, as I explained in my last lecture, the rights of possession,
which had been notoriously invaded in the last reign; and which, from the
continuance of the old parties, could not even, in this reign, be fairly
determined in the inferior courts<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>.</p>

<p>Not that this was their sole business; for they had in their commissions
power to enquire into several other matters, such, particularly, as the king
found, by the advice he had received from the several counties, to be evils
not likely to be remedied in the county courts. These were, before every
commission for justices itinerant in eyre went out, digested under certain
articles, called <i>Capitula Itineris</i>, or <i>The chief heads of the eyre</i> or <i>circuit</i>,
which specified what actions they were to deal with. These were, in
general (for the commissions varied at different times, being sometimes
more, sometimes less extensive) <i>civil</i> and <i>criminal</i> actions, happening between
party and party; actions brought at the suit of the crown, either for
public crimes, or the usurpation of liberties, franchises, or jurisdiction from
the crown, which had been very frequent in the former times of confusion;
and also the escheats of the king.</p>

<p>The thing I find most remarkable is, that, in these distributions of England
into circuits, are omitted some counties, (I do not mean Middlesex,
where the <i>curia regis</i> sat, or Chester, which was a county palatine, for they
of course were not to be included) as particularly Lincoln, in the second
eyre; also York, in the second eyre, is but one county, whereas, in the
first, it is two, York and Richmond; as in Lancashire also, Lancaster, and
Copeland; and Rutland is omitted in both. All which shews, that the
limits and divisions of all the counties were not ascertained with precision at
that time. The second eyre was instituted three years after the first, by
parliament also held at Windsor, and in this there were but four circuits.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
After these two first, the king appointed the circuits, and distributed the
counties at his pleasure.</p>

<p>The usual times of their going was once in seven years. However, they
were not stated certainly; for sometimes, if there was a more than ordinary
complaint of want of justice, they went every three or four years, and
sometimes, if there was no complaint, they were intermitted beyond seven.
Neither was the number of judges sent on the circuits fixed, but alterable
at the king’s pleasure.</p>

<p>The determinations in these circuits, being under the inspection of men
of integrity and skill, were in high estimation, and accordingly are several
times quoted by Bracton, as being of as great authority as the decisions in
the <i>curia regis</i>; and in consequence thereof, the business in the county
courts continually declined; justice was every day administered worse in
them, and at length they were confined, except in some cases, to pleas under
forty shillings. Nay even these were, upon application, easily removeable
by a writ called a <i>pone</i>, into the king’s courts<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.</p>

<p>But as the hopes of obtaining justice in the inferior courts waxed every
day more faint, it was found necessary, during the intervals of the eyres,
to substitute other courts in their place. Hence the invention of <i>justices of
assizes</i>, of <i>oyer and terminer</i>, of <i>goal delivery</i>; and the necessity of affairs
afterwards obliging these to be sent very frequently, it was thought fit,
about the end of Edward the Third’s reign, to lay aside the justices in eyre,
as superfluous, since these other did their business, except as to pleas of the
king’s forests, where the <i>eyres</i> were continued. And, in process of time,
to prevent the enormous expence of bringing juries up to the king’s
courts, the justices of the <i>nisi prius</i> were instituted, to try issues joined in
the king’s courts, and, the verdicts so found to return to the court from
whence the record was brought; which court, on the record so found, proceeds
to judgment. These are the judges who now transact the county business
in their circuits, under the several commissions before-mentioned;
and going regularly twice every year for that purpose, the whole business
they transact is, in common speech, called <i>Assizes</i>; that being, in the antient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
times of their institution, the principal part of their employment,
though now such actions are scarce ever brought; personal actions, which
may repeatedly be tried, having superseded them<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>.</p>

<p>About this time, also, it seems that the <i>curia regis</i>, the business there
increasing, was divided, for the more convenient dispatch thereof, into four
courts; and to each its separate jurisdiction allotted. The exchequer, indeed,
was in some sort a separate court before, and had its distinct business
of the province; and in it the treasurer, not the <i>Justiciarius Angliæ</i>, presided,
as he did in the other courts. It is not impossible that, before this time,
they had, in the <i>curia regis</i>, set apart different days for different kinds of
causes. But they were all, in one respect, the same court; because they
had the same judges, namely, all such nobles as attended the court. But
this being found inconvenient, as these great men were generally ignorant
in law, and business began to encrease, it was found proper to appoint settled
skilful judges, and to divide the court, and appoint each part its separate
jurisdiction. However, those limits were not exactly settled, or, at least,
not exactly observed, for some time after: For we find in John’s reign,
that <i>common pleas</i>, that is, civil suits between party and party, and particularly
fines of lands, which are of the same nature, were held in the King’s
Bench; though, on the contrary, we find no pleas of the crown tried in
the court of Common Pleas. I suppose the reason was, that the latter being
derived out of the former, the king’s bench had a concurrent jurisdiction
with it, until restrained by that branch of Magna Charta, <i>Communia
placita non sequantur curiam nostram</i>. The first of those courts in dignity
and power, especially while the <i>Justiciarius Angliæ</i> remained, was the <i>King’s
Bench</i>, though of late days the Chancery hath over-topped it. Here, as
the king used frequently, in the antient times, to sit in person, the king is
supposed always present; which is the reason why a blow given in this court,
upon any provocation whatsoever, is punished with the loss of the hand, as
it is done in the presence of the king. The proper jurisdiction of this court
is causes where the king is either directly or indirectly concerned, except
as to his revenue<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>In all <i>pleas of the crown</i> therefore, that is, suits of the king to punish
offences, as indictment of treason, felony, breach of the peace, are proper
subjects for this court. He is indirectly concerned in this, that all erroneous
judgments, given in the Common Pleas, or other inferior courts,
are here reformed; for the king is concerned to see justice done to his
subjects.</p>

<p>Secondly, for the same reason, this is a proper court to grant prohibitions
to courts that exceed their jurisdiction, though this is not particular
to the King’s Bench, but common to all the four courts.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it hath cognizance of all privileges and franchises, claimed by
any private persons or corporations; and if any usurped upon the king in
this respect, they are called in, by a <i>quo warranto</i>, to shew by what title
they claim such privileges. Likewise where any member of a corporation
is disfranchised, or removed from, or disturbed in his office, here shall he
be remedied. For when a king has given a franchise, he is concerned,
in honour and interest, to see that every man entitled, shall enjoy the benefit
of it.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the king is interested in the life, limbs, and liberty of every
subject. Therefore this is the court wherein appeals, brought by private
persons, of murder, felony, and maim, should be tried; and if any man
complains of wrongful imprisonment, this court shall, by writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, have him brought into court, with the cause of his imprisonment
returned; and if the cause is insufficient to discharge him, or if the offence
he is charged with be bailable, to bail him. Nay, this court, in favour
of liberty, hath a power, in all cases; they may, if they see proper, bail a
man for crimes that are not ordinarily bailable by common law.</p>

<p>Fifthly, they have a right to hold plea of all the trespasses done <i>vi &amp;
armis</i>, though brought principally for a private reparation to the party; for
this action favours of a criminal nature, and the king is entitled to a fine
for the breach of the peace.</p>

<p>Lastly, it has cognizance of all personal actions brought against persons
that have the privilege of this court. The persons privileged are two,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
first the officers of the court, who are supposed to be constantly attendant
thereon, and to whom it would be inconvenient, as well as to the court, to
sue or be sued elsewhere; and therefore the privilege extends to suits
brought as well by, as against such officers; secondly, the prisoners who
are in the custody of the marshal of the court, and who are consequently
not at liberty to appear in any other. These therefore can only be sued
here; for the court will, in such case, order the prisoner up from their
own prison to make his defence; and, under the colour of this rule, they
now, by a fiction, make all sorts of a actions suable in this court; for it is
only alledging the defendant is in the custody of the marshal, though in
fact he is not, and that is held sufficient to found the jurisdiction<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall next proceed to the jurisdiction of the high court of Chancery,
the second in antient times, but for some ages past the first court of the
realm.</p>

<p><i>The jurisdiction of the high court of chancery—The Chancellor, a very considerable

of the court of chancery—The chancery, assistant to the exchequer in matters
of the King’s revenue—Other branches of the business of this court.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In my last lecture, having taken notice, that, in the reign of Henry the
Second, the <i>curia regis</i> and the <i>Exchequer</i>, which dealt with the king’s
revenue, were distinct courts, and that there were even traces of the <i>Common
Pleas</i>, as another court, different from the higher court, the <i>curia regis</i>;
I took occasion to treat of these several courts, and the several limits of
their jurisdictions; although the now general opinion be, that these courts
were not separated till after the barons wars, that is, not until an hundred
years later; which opinion, as I conceive, hath, thus far, its foundation in
truth, that the precise limits of their several jurisdictions were not perfectly
ascertained, and kept distinct till then, though the division had been made
before, that is, about the time I am now treating of. For, if it be a good
maxim, as my Lord Coke says, <i>boni judicis est officium ampliare jurisdictionem</i>,
it is not to be wondered at, that, for some time after the separation, the
<i>Justiciarius Angliæ</i>, who had the sole jurisdiction in him before, should retain,
in many instances, the exertion of it, where, after the separation, the
matter properly belonged to another court.</p>

<p>The maxim, indeed, is, in my opinion, utterly false. For where there
are separate courts with distinct powers, surely it is the duty of each court,
were it only to prevent confusion, to keep within their proper limits. However
thus much must be allowed in justification of Lord Coke’s maxim,
that, as it is too much the inclination of human nature, when in power, to
grasp at more than is properly our due, so the judges of all courts, and of
all nations, have been as little exempt from this infirmity as any other set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
of men. Witness the outrageous usurpation upon the temporal jurisdiction
in antient days, both by the ecclesiastical judges in the times of the Pope’s
grandeur, and by the judges of the constables and admirals courts, when
supported by arbitrary kings<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.</p>

<p>The temporal judges, on the other hand, with a firmness highly to be
commended, have successfully not only resisted these encroachments, but,
by way of reprizals, have, in these latter days, made considerable inroads
into the antiently allowed territories of those courts; not to the detriment
of the subject, I must confess; for the method of trial by the common law,
is certainly preferable to theirs. But the common law courts have not satisfied
themselves with extending their jurisdiction, in derogation of those
courts, which they justly looked on, in those days, as enemies to them,
and to the laws and constitution of the kingdom, but they have made invasions
into each others territories, and, by what they call <i>fictions of law</i>, have
made almost all causes, except criminal ones, cognizable in any court; contrary
to the very intention of dividing the courts; which was, that each
should have their separate business, and that the judges and practitioners,
by being confined in a narrower track, should be more expert in their different
provinces<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.</p>

<p>In treating of these courts, I began with the <i>King’s Bench</i>, which, as
long as the office of <i>Justiciarius Angliæ</i> subsisted, was the superior; but
since Edward the First discontinued that office, on account of its too great
power, and the business of that officer hath been shared between several
judges, the rank of this court hath declined, and the <i>Chancery</i> hath obtained
the first place. To this court, then, I shall now proceed. And as in
it there are, at present, and have been for some ages, two distinct courts,
one <i>ordinary</i>, proceeding by common law, and the other <i>extraordinary</i>, according
to the maxims of equity, where common law could give no relief;
I shall, for the present, confine myself to the former, and defer treating of
the latter, until I come to that period when the <i>Equity jurisdiction</i> arose.</p>

<p>In the antient times, before the division of the courts, the chancellor
was a very considerable officer of the <i>curia regis</i>. It was his business to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
write and seal with the great <i>seal</i> the <i>diplomata</i>, or <i>chartæ regis</i>, what we
now call <i>letters patents</i>; to issue all writs, either for founding the jurisdiction
of the <i>curia regis</i>, and the bringing causes into that court, that by the
antient law belonged to the courts in the country; or those to the nobles,
to summon them to attend the <i>commune concilium</i>, or parliament. Afterwards,
when the House of Commons was formed, he issued writs to the proper
places, for the election of the members thereof. Hence, when the courts
were divided, the making out letters patents, the keeping the inrolments
thereof, and issuing of <i>original writs</i>, as they are called, that is, those that
found the jurisdiction of courts, and other writs of like nature, continued
to belong to him; and, as these records remained with him, there arose to
him a jurisdiction concerning them; except as to such writs as were intended
to found the jurisdiction of another court, which, though issued from
Chancery, were returnable into the proper court, and the cause determined
there<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.</p>

<p>The first branch of the jurisdiction of this court, then, was the repeal of
letters patents, that had issued improvidently, to the detriment of either of
the king or the subject; and this properly fell to the lot of the chancellor,
as he made out the patents, and kept the enrolments of them. The method
of repealing those was by a writ called <i>scire facias</i> notified to the party
claiming under the patent, and calling him in to shew cause why it should
not be revoked. This <i>scire facias</i> issued in three cases: the first, at the suit
of a subject; where two patents were granted to two persons of the same
thing, the first patentee brought a <i>scire facias</i> against the second, to repeal
his grant; the other two were at the suit of the king, where the king was
deceived, either by false suggestions of merit, or as to the value of the thing
granted; or, in the second place, if the king had, by his patent, granted
what by law he could not have granted. Here, if the case was clear in law,
and there was no controverted matter of fact necessary to be settled, to ascertain
the right, the chancellor was judge; and if his judgment was against
the patent, it was his duty to <i>cancel</i> the inrolment thereof; from which part
of his office he had his name. I say if the case was clear in law, and there
was no controverted matter of fact; for, if this latter was the case, he could
not try it, he being antiently but an officer of the <i>curia regis</i>, and not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
judge; and therefore unqualified to summon a jury. The rule continued
the same after the separation of the courts, and his becoming a judge; principally,
as I conceive, for the preservation of the common law, and the birthright
of Englishmen, the trial by jury. For, as the chancellor was almost
always, in those days, an ecclesiastic, and consequently supposed more attached
to the <i>civil</i> and <i>canon law</i>, there might be danger, if he was suffered
to try matter of fact himself, he might introduce a new method of trial.
When, therefore, the cause was heard upon a <i>demurrer</i>, that is, the facts
admitted of both sides, and only the law in dispute, he gave judgment;
but if they came to issue on a fact, he must carry the record over to the
King’s Bench, who summoned the jury, and gave judgment on the verdict<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p>Another branch of his jurisdiction was with relation to the inquisitions
of office. There are many officers whose duty it is to take care of the profits
and revenues of the king, and to that purpose they are sworn in the Exchequer;
such as <i>escheators</i>, <i>sheriffs</i>, and others, whose duty it is to make
enquiry what the king is entitled to in their respective limits, whether lands
or chattels, or by what title. For this purpose they are to summon juries,
and to return the verdicts found to the court of the revenue of the Exchequer,
in order that that court may take care of the king’s rights. These
were called <i>inquisitions</i>, or <i>enquiries</i>, <i>of office</i>, as proceeding from the duty of
an officer that made them. But these officers being negligent in the performance
of this their duty, it became sometimes necessary, and afterwards
customary to quicken them, by issuing writs for this purpose; and these
writs issued out of Chancery, the <i>Officina Brevium</i>; and then, that it might
be seen they were properly obeyed, the return of the inquisition was made
into the court that issued the writ, and thus, the Chancery gained a jurisdiction
in this point, and became an assistant to the Exchequer in the matters
of the king’s revenue; not indeed in the administration thereof, but in
bringing it into the king’s possession<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>.</p>

<p>It is a maxim in the English law, that nothing can pass from the king to
a subject but by <i>matter of record</i>, which maxim was not only advantageous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
to the royal estate, as preventive of persons getting grants by surprise, but
also advantageous to the subject in the firmness of his title, when once he
had obtained it. And, on the contrary, the regular and equal way of restoring
possessions to the crown was by record also, that is, by inquisitions
finding the king’s title returned, as I have mentioned. But as the verdicts
taken in these inquisitions may be erroneous, and detrimental to another person,
by finding what was really his property, to have been the property of
another, and to have accrued to the king by forfeiture or escheat; and as,
regularly, by another maxim of law, there is no averring against or contesting
a record, it was necessary that the bare return of inquisition into Chancery
should not be final and conclusive, but that time should be given to
any that thought himself affected to claim his right. Hence a month’s
time is given by statute, after the return of the inquisition, in which any person
may come in and <i>traverse the office</i>, that is, contest the validity of it.
And here the chancellor is judge, in the same manner as in the repeal of
letters patents, that is, if the subject of the controversy depends merely upon
matter of law; but if the parties come to an issue on matter of fact, he cannot
try it, for the reason above given, but it must go to the King’s
Bench<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>.</p>

<p>Another branch of the judicial business is the hearing of petitions to
the king for justice in his own causes. No man, by the feudal principles of
our law, can bring an action against the king. For the charging him with
wrong doing would be a breach of fealty. The king cannot, by our law,
do wrong; but yet, from the multiplicity of his occupations, or from his
being misinformed, the subject may sometimes suffer wrong from him. The
remedy thereof, in this case, is by humble petition to the king, that he
would enquire into the cause, and do justice to the party, which, though
conceived in an humbler strain, is as effectual as an action, and must be
tried in this court, the proper channel to convey his majesty’s graces, and
the king, by his chancellor, dispenses justice to the party.</p>

<p>Another branch of the judicial business of this court was the proceeding
in certain cases against persons privileged, that is, the officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
court, who being supposed to be constantly attendant, were to be sued here,
as the officers of other courts, were in their respective courts.</p>

<p>Lastly, this court had jurisdiction with respect to proceeding upon <i>recognizances</i>,
or acknowledgments of obligations taken in this court, which
being here recorded, and not to be removed, were properly here triable<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>.</p>

<p>There are some other causes, proper for the jurisdiction of Chancery,
which would carry me too far at present. I shall, therefore, conclude here
with mentioning one striking difference between this and the other courts,
that they sit only in the times of the four terms, whereas it is open all the
year. The confining the others to the terms arose from the religion of the
times, and the inquisitions of canon law, which forbad courts to be held
during the seasons of the three great festivals, and of harvest. In obedience
to this law, I may say (for the papal power was then very high in England)
was our Michaelmas vacation set apart for the solemnization of Christmas,
the Hillary vacation for Easter, the Easter vacation for Whitsuntide, and the
Trinity or long vacation, for the uses of husbandry. But great would be
the evils, if that court which is the <i>Officina Justiciæ</i>, the Shop of Justice,
were to be ever shut. Writs, therefore, issued hence at all times, and all
such causes as, for the public good, cannot brook delay till the ordinary
times of sitting of other courts, are here handled in the vacations, such as to
mention a few, <i>habeas corpus’s</i> and <i>homine replegiando’s</i>, to restore persons
imprisoned to liberty, prohibitions to keep inferior courts within
their proper limits; and <i>replevins</i>, to restore the possession of goods distrained.</p>

<p>But the great business of this court, as a court of common law, was, that
it was the <i>Officina Brevium</i>, the shop where original writs were purchased by
suitors, in order to commence their actions. An <i>original writ</i>, in the most
common form, is an order to the sheriff to summon the party complained of
to do justice to, or else to answer to the complainant in the proper court;
containing a short description of the complainant’s title, and the wrong done
to him, from whence, in Latin, it is called <i>Breve</i>, and answers to the original
citation in the Roman and ecclesiastical laws. This, and the making
out patents, was the principal business of the chancellor in the <i>curia regis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
and therefore naturally continued with him after the division of the courts.
The reasons assigned by Gilbert for having one of these superior courts a public
shop for justice, are three; first, that it might appear that all power of
judicature flowed from the crown; secondly, that the crown might not be
defrauded of the fines due to it for suffering persons to desert the inferior
courts, and to sue for justice immediately from the king; and lastly, to preserve
an uniformity in the law; for these writs being made out in one constant
form contributed greatly thereto, being both a direction to the judge,
and a limitation of his authority.</p>

<p>Originally, the chancellor heard the complaints of the person injured,
and formed a writ according to the nature of the case, but as, among a rude
military people, little versed in commerce, and the variety of transactions
that attend it, the complaints of the people were confined in a narrow compass,
it but seldom happened, after some time, that there was occasion for
making a new writ, in a form different from what had been used before.
These forms, therefore, were collected into a book of our law, called the
<i>Register</i>, the antientest book of our law; and the making them out, being
now matter of course, nothing more than copying out the old terms, inserting
the proper names of persons, and places, and the chancellor’s business
encreasing, became devolved upon the chancellor’s clerks, the <i>Clerici</i>,
as they were antiently, or the <i>Masters</i>, as they are now called, of
Chancery; and they were restrained from making out any of a different
form from those in the Register. However, as, in process of
time, cases would happen which none of the forms in that book would
suit, and it was looked on as the corner-stone of the law, the chancellor
could not of himself venture to make out new and unusual writs,
but referred the complainants, in such cases, to petition the parliament
for remedy<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>.</p>

<p>These petitions afterwards growing too frequent, and interrupting the
public business, it was found necessary to enlarge the power of the Masters
of Chancery, and to give them a qualified power of forming new
writs. This was done by the statute of Westminster the second, cap.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
24, in Edward the First’s reign; it runs thus: <i>Quotiescunque de cætero
evenerit me cancellaria, quod in uno casu reperitur breve, &amp; in consimili
casu cadente sub eodem jure, &amp; simili indigente remedio, non reperitur, concordent
clerici de cancellaria in breve faciendo, vel atterminent querentes in
proximum parliamentum, &amp; scribantur casus, in quibus concordare non possunt,
&amp; referant eos ad proximum parliamentum, &amp; de consensu jurisperitorum
fiat breve ne contingat de cætero, quod curia domini regis deficiat
conquerentibus in justitia perquirenda</i>; which last words, <i>ne contingat</i>, &amp;c.
gave a handle, as I shall shew hereafter, to this court to erect their equitable
jurisdiction<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>.</p>

<p>We see how this power given to the Masters was limited: it must
be exercised only in cases parallel to such as there was a remedy already
provided for; all the Masters must agree in the form of the new
writ; and the remedy must be the same as was in the similar case in
the Register. To illustrate this by the example of the first writ formed
by the Masters upon this statute, and which therefore, by way of
eminence, is called a <i>writ, in consimili casu</i>. The statute of Glocester
ordered the Chancery to form a writ for the relief of the person in reversion,
where a tenant in power had aliened her dower. The writ was
accordingly framed, and inserted in the Register. Now, by virtue of
this statute of Westminster, the Masters framed the writ <i>in casu consimili</i>,
in favour of the person in reversion, where a tenant by the courtesy,
or tenant for life, had aliened, he being equally damaged as the
former case. But though this was particularly called <i>a writ, in casu
consimili</i>, there were many others formed by virtue of this statute, such
as for various kinds of trespasses unknown in former ages, and actions
upon the case, so frequent in these our days, and so called, because
the writ is formed according to the circumstances of the case, and
not upon the old forms continued in the Register.</p>

<p>This new employment of Masters in Chancery, and the business of
the court encreasing, created a necessity of erecting new officers, to
make out the <i>brevia de cursu</i>, namely, those in the Register, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
therefore called <i>Curritors</i>. The chief of the Masters is <i>Keeper of the
Rolls</i> of this court, which was formerly a part of the chancellor’s business;
and he is therefore called <i>Master of the Rolls</i>. For ages past,
since the Equity business multiplied in England, this officer has been
there, in matters of equity, an assistant judge to the chancellor, but
his decrees are liable to a rehearing, and to be reversed by the chancellor.
But in this kingdom, the office hath not had any judicial authority
annexed to it.</p>

<p><i>The court of Common Bench or Common Pleas—The jurisdiction of this court—Actions
real, personal, or mixt—The court of Exchequer—The jurisdiction of
this court—Exchequer chamber—The judicature of Parliament.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The next of the superior courts, is the <i>Common Bench</i>, or <i>Common Pleas</i>,
as it is more commonly called, being the proper court for the determining
suits between subjects, wherein the king is not concerned; and upon
the multiplication of business in the <i>curia regis</i>, it was separated from it,
for the more speedy and easy dispatching the affairs of the people. As in
the very old times the king often sat in person in the <i>curia regis</i>, and that
he might have an opportunity of so doing when he pleased, that court always
followed the king wherever he went within the kingdom of England;
and in those days it was customary for the kings to take progresses; and reside
in the different seasons of the year in different parts of the kingdom, as
we see, by the variety of places where the parliaments were held in old
times. The same practice of the courts and the records following the person
of the king continued in France longer than in England. For when
king John was taken by the black prince at the battle of Poictiers, the antient
records of that kingdom were lost, and there are scarce any now remaining
there, of what had passed previous to that time, except enrolments
made since, of the antient charters that were in the hands of the subjects.</p>

<p>But in England the constant removal of the courts was found very burdensome
to the people, who had suits much earlier. For their ease, therefore,
it was enacted in <i>Magna Charta</i>, that <i>communia placita non sequantur
curiam nostram, sed teneantur in aliquo certo loco</i>; that the Court of Common
Pleas should no longer be ambulatory, but held in one certain place.
Westminster was the place fixed upon, and there, if we except some occasional
removals, on account of epidemical sicknesses, hath it been held ever
since. And in long space of time after, the other courts became, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
not in pursuance of any positive law, fixed there also. By their becoming
settled in a certain place, one great inconvenience, besides the hardships on
the suitors, was avoided, namely, the loss and imbezzlement of the records
by these frequent removals. For it is very remarkable, that there is not a
record remaining of the times previous to the fixing of the courts, not even
the enrolments of the acts of parliament themselves, except a few, and a
very few, of the courts of Exchequer, which, concerning the king’s revenue,
were more carefully preserved<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>.</p>

<p>But the greatest advantage that attended this change was the improvement
of the law, and, what was a consequence thereof, the preservation of
the liberty of the subject. For now it became much more convenient for
persons to apply to that study, when they were no longer under a necessity
of removing. And we therefore, soon after, find the practitioners of the
law settled together, something in a collegiate manner; and after the dissolution
of the order of Knights Templars, the habitation of these latter, called
the <i>Temple</i>, was granted to them for their residence and improvement.
Here, they continued to confer the degrees of <i>Apprentices, or Barristers at
law</i>, and <i>Sergeants at law</i>, which they had began before, in imitation of
the bachelors and doctors degrees in universities.</p>

<p>The preservation of the liberty of the subject was, as I said before, another
happy consequence that resulted from the fixing the courts, and the
uniting the professors of the law into one body. For as, about this time
the study of the civil and canon laws was eagerly pursued by the clergy in
the universities, and the English customs as much depreciated by them as
possible, and as those two laws were founded on maxims of despotism, and,
as such, encouraged and supported to the utmost by the popes, and all
kings that aimed at arbitrary power, the common lawyers were necessitated,
for the support of their profession, to take the popular side of the
question, and to stickle for the old Saxon freedom, and limited form of
government.</p>

<p>Hence the steady opposition they made, even in those early times, to the
king’s dispensing. Nay, they carried their zeal for liberty so far, as (since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
they could not directly, in those days, oppose the weight of the civil law)
to quote the very passages of it that were in favour of absolute power, and
by their glosses make it speak the language of liberty. Thus Bracton quotes
that text: <i>Quod principi placet, legis habet vigorem</i>; that is, in its true meaning,
the monarch is sole legislator: but Bracton’s comment is, <i>id est, non
quicquid de voluntate regis temere presumptum fuerit, sed quod concilio magistratuum
suorum, rege auctoritatem præstante, habita super hoc deliberatione &amp; tractatu,
recte fuerit definitum</i>; that is, the king is not sole legislator; directly
contrary to the sense of the very text he quotes. And it must be allowed,
to the honour of the common lawyers, that, with the exception of a few
venal time-serving individuals, they have, for a succession of ages, proved
themselves true friends to a rational civil liberty in the subject, and to reasonable
power and prerogative in the king<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>.</p>

<p>To come to the jurisdiction of this court. Its proper business, as appears
from its name, is to take cognizance of all <i>common pleas</i>, that is, all pleas
that are not pleas of the crown, or at the suit of the king. With these it
cannot meddle; for all actions at the suit of the king for criminal matters,
belong to the King’s Bench, as those for his revenue do properly to the Exchequer.
But it hath jurisdiction, and that universally, throughout England,
in all civil causes, whether <i>real</i>, <i>personal</i>, or <i>mixt</i>; the distinction of
which it will not be amiss just to point out.</p>

<p>Real <i>actions</i> are those that are brought to recover land itself, where the
claimant has a right to an estate in it for life at least; and these, until within
these two hundred and fifty years, were the only ones used for that purpose;
but, since that time, they are gone almost entirely out of use, on account
of their nicety, their delays, their being conclusive; and their place
is supplied by mixed actions, which are easier, shorter, and may be tried again.
However, if any one was inclined, at this day, to bring such an action,
this is the court to bring it in; and therefore all <i>common recoveries</i>,
which antiently were, and still carry the form of, real actions, are suffered
in this court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>Personal <i>actions</i> are those that are brought for the recovery either of
some duty, or demand in particular, or of damages for the non-performance
of some promise or contract, entered into, or lastly such as are brought by
a man to recover a compensation in damages for some injury sustained in
his person—or property. To give but one or two instances of these last:
If my ground is trespassed on, if my person is assaulted, my reputation injured,
the remedy is by the personal actions of <i>trespass</i>, <i>assault &amp; battery</i>,
or <i>slander</i>. All actions for breach of covenants are likewise personal actions;
for, by the common law, damages only are recoverable thereon,
and the party is not obliged to perform the covenant. Wherefore, if a
man chuses rather to have his covenant performed than receive a satisfaction
in damages, he must go into a Court of Equity, which will oblige a
man to perform in specie, what he hath specifically engaged to perform, if
the performance is possible. This court, therefore, being the proper court
for personal actions, fines of lands are levied here; for they are fictitious
actions, founded on a fictitious breach of covenant.</p>

<p>Mixed actions are designed for the recovery of a specific thing, and also
damages, and consequently partake of the nature both of real and personal
actions. For instance: If a tenant for life, or years, or at will, commits
waste, he forfeits to the owner of the inheritance the place wherein the
waste was done, and treble damages. The <i>action of waste</i>, therefore being
brought to recover both, is a mixed action. The action of <i>ejectment</i>
also, which was originally proper to recover damages for being put out of
a lease for years, but is now the common remedy, substituted in the lieu of
real actions, is now of the same nature; because both the land itself, and
damages for the wrong are recovered<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.</p>

<p>These three kinds of actions are properly the business of this court,
though, as to the two last, actions personal and mixed, the courts of King’s
Bench and Exchequer have, by fictions, gained a concurrent jurisdiction
with this court; the King’s Bench, by supposing the defendant to be in
the custody of the marshal thereof; and the Exchequer, by supposing the
plaintiff to be a debtor to the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>The proper way of founding the jurisdiction of this writ, is by a writ out
of Chancery, returnable hither, either to begin a cause originally here, or to
remove one depending in an inferior court not of record; but, in some
cases, they proceed without any writ from Chancery, as in causes brought
by or against an officer of the court, and likewise, in granting prohibitions
to other courts that attempt to enlarge their jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I must observe, that this court, though one of the
four high courts derived out of the <i>curia regis</i>, is not, however, supreme,
but subordinate to the King’s Bench. For judgments given therein are reversible
in the King’s Bench, by a writ of error issuing from the Chancery,
suggesting the king’s being informed that manifest error has interveened,
and commanding the record to be transmitted into the King’s Bench; the
judges belonging to which, upon the face of it, and nothing else, are to affirm
or reverse the judgment; for the error must be manifest; and no error
in point of fact, but error only in point of law, can be averred against a
record.</p>

<p>The lowest in rank of the four great courts, though from antient times
one of the greatest importance, is the court of <i>Exchequer</i>, whose business
was to collect in the several debts, fines, amerciaments, or other duties or
properties belonging or accruing to the king, and likewise, to issue money
by his orders; and this court being originally solely erected for the king’s
profit, is the reason, I presume, why it is held in rank the lowest; it being
more honourable to the crown to give precedence of rank to those courts
that were intended for the administration of justice to the subject, above
that which was intended merely for the king’s temporal advantage. Besides,
this court was, in its original, distinct from the <i>curia regis</i>, the treasurer
being the judge in this, as the <i>justiciarius Angliæ</i> was in the other; and
therefore, it was regular, that the Chancery, and Common Pleas, as having
been once part of the supreme court, should take place before this. Its
having been originally a distinct court, accounts for its independency on the
King’s Bench; for, no writ of error lies from it to the King’s Bench, as doth
from the Common Pleas, but its errors are rectified in another manner<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>This court, as well as the Chancery, hath, properly speaking, two courts:
one, ordinary, proceeding according to the strict rules of the common
law; the other, by equity; for, as it is the king’s duty to render justice
with mercy, so, in this court, the rights of the king are not always exacted
with rigour; but, on circumstances of reason and equity, may be
mitigated or discharged. The court of common law in this court had antiently
much more business than of late. Originally, whilst the royal demesnes
were unalienated, they had the setting of them for years; but,
afterwards, people chusing rather the authority of the great seal, took them
in Chancery. That court, as I mentioned when treating of it, had likewise
gained the returns of inquisitions of office, and had also gained by act
of parliament, the composition of forfeitures, for the king’s tenants <i>in capite</i>
aliening their lands without license; which, otherwise, would have belonged
to this court. The erection of the <i>Court of Wards</i>, also, by Henry the Eighth,
took off that branch of its jurisdiction; and the abolishing of the military
tenures by Charles the Second took away the business of calling in their
fruits. The erecting the office of <i>the Treasury</i>, as distinct, for the issuing
of money, had the same effect; but, above all, the erecting new jurisdictions,
and appointing new judges to try causes relative to the new taxes, as
the Commissioners of the Customs and Excise, and Commissioners of Appeal,
diminished the peculiar business of the court<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be now proper to consider the nature and extent of their present
jurisdiction. Here then are sworn the sheriffs, and other officers concerned
in the king’s revenue and duties; and here they are to return, and make up
their accounts. Here, likewise, the king sues his debtors, or even the debtor
of his debtor (for so far his prerogative extends); and here also, for enabling
his debtors to pay him, they are priviledged to sue their debtors; an allowance
that hath grown up by degrees to extend the jurisdiction of this court,
and to make it concurrent with the Common Pleas. For it is only alledging,
(and this they will not allow to be traversed or denied) that the plaintiff is
the king’s debtor, and the business is done. The court acquires an immediate
jurisdiction. The same allegation is likewise necessary, when a suit of
equity is commenced in this court; for otherwise, the suit would, on the
face of it, appear to belong to Chancery. I need scarce observe, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
officers of this court are to sue and be sued here; for that is a privilege common
to the officers of all the courts, arising from their personal attendance.
Here, likewise, the king’s attorney-general exhibits informations for concealment
of customs and seizures, informations upon penal statutes, where
there is a fine due to the king, forfeitures and breach of covenant to the
king; likewise all informations for intrusions, wastes, spoils or encroachments
on the king’s lands; in general, where the crown suffers in its
profits.</p>

<p>In this court of common law, the <i>Barons of Exchequer</i> only are judges,
and are called <i>Barons</i>, because antiently none were judges there under that
degree. In the Court of Equity, the chancellor of the Exchequer is joined
with them, though it must be owned this officer hath seldom, of late years,
acted either in England or Ireland, in his judicial capacity, and it hath
been considered little more than as a great lucrative place. Errors in this
court are not, as I observed before, redressed in the King’s Bench, as those
of the Common Pleas are, but in another court, called the Exchequer
Chamber, consisting of the lord chancellor, lord treasurer, and chief
judges.</p>

<p>There is another court of <i>Exchequer Chamber</i> in England, tho’ we
have none such in this kingdom, erected 27th Eliz. and composed of
the judges of the Common Pleas and barons of the Exchequer, in which
lies a writ of error from the King’s Bench, to reverse judgments in certain
suits commenced there originally. Into this court are frequently
removed, or adjourned from any of the other courts, causes that are of a
new impression, and attended with difficulty, or even such concerning
which the judges, perhaps, entertain no great doubts, but are new, and
attended with extensive consequences; and this, for the more solemn
determination, that all the judges of all the courts might be consulted about
establishing a new precedent. Antiently such causes were adjourned into
parliament, but the legislative business of that high court increasing, this
court was substituted for the above purpose of consultation<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>To finish this account concerning the superior courts at once, it will be
proper to say something of the supreme judicature of all, that of parliament.
Antiently, as I have frequently observed, all causes but such as
concerned the king or peers, or those that were of great difficulty, or such
as justice could not be expected in by law, were dispatched in the county
courts, the rest by petition to the king in parliament, or, in the intervals
thereof, in the <i>curia regis</i>, which originally was but a committee thereof,
appointed by the king. Hence matters determined there, were subject to
a review in parliament; writs of error from the King’s Bench returned
there; and when the Equity courts grew up, appeals from the Chancery
and Exchequer in matters of equity. This power of judicature is peculiar
to the lords (for the parliament consisted at first only of them, and
when the commons were introduced, they sat in a distinct house) and the
parliament hears at present only matters that come from other courts by
appeal, or by writ of error, which is in the nature of an appeal, and no
causes originally. It is true, that, for a long time after the division of the
courts, many causes by petition were brought into parliament in the first
instance; but these being generally referred to the courts below, the practice
ceased, and would not now be allowed. For a long time accusations
against peers were originally admitted, but at present, and for this long
time, indictments found below are required before a peer can be tried; nor
can the trial of peers by impeachment in parliament be considered as an
original trial, for the commons are considered as the grand inquest or grand
jury of the whole nation, and therefore an impeachment by them is not only
equivalent to, but has and ought to have greater weight than any indictment
by any private grand jury.</p>

<p>In this judicature of the lords, an impeachment there, is one singularity,
an exception to the grand rule, that every man is to be tried by his peers,
and that is, that a commoner impeached by the commons shall be tried by
the lords. The reason of this procedure seems to be, that all the commons
of England are supposed parties to the accusation, when their representatives
have accused him, and it might be dangerous to trust his life
with a common jury; but the lords are strangers to the charge, and it is
their interest to controul the commons, if they proceed with too great
violence<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Henry II.’s dispute with Becket—The constitutions of Clarendon—The murder
of Becket.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having, in a general manner, run through the jurisdictions of the
several great courts of the kingdom, which were divided from each
other about the time I am now treating of, though the division was not
compleated, nor the several limits exactly adjusted till some time after; I
shall proceed, in a summary way, with the few remaining observations I
have to make, with respect to the state of the law during the reign of
Henry the Second. And the greatest and most remarkable of these was
his dispute with Becket, archbishop of Canterbury; a contest attended with
the most fatal effects, and which makes up a considerable part of the civil
history of that reign. The particular circumstances that attended it, and
the many turns it took, I shall not dwell on; but, as it arose from the
clashing of contrary laws, I shall briefly lay open its source, and give an
account of the events.</p>

<p>From the year of Christ one thousand, the popes had every day been
encreasing their power, and extending their pretensions. They set themselves
up, at first, as protectors of the clergy, who really had been oppressed
by the temporal princes, and in order to attach them more firmly
to their interests, they made canons in councils, and published decretal
epistles, by their own sole authority; which, in those days of superstition,
were too readily received as laws; all tending to depress the civil power, to
raise the ecclesiastical on its ruins, and, in short, to pave the way for making
the pope supreme monarch of the world, in matters temporal as well as
spiritual. The emperors, however, stickled hard, on the other hand, to
support their rights, and particularly to maintain to themselves the nomination
of the popes, as well as of other bishops, which the popes had transferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
to the people of Rome first, and afterwards to the clergy alone; so that,
for a good part of this time, there was a schism in the church, and two
popes in being, the one named by the emperor, and the other elected; and
I observed before, William Rufus kept himself independent by acknowledging
neither, and was absolute master of the church. However, the
popes that were elected, generally gained ground. They had the majority
of the clergy on their side, and indeed most of the sovereign princes of
Europe, who were jealous lest the emperor, under pretence of being successor
to the Romans, might arrogate a superiority over them.</p>

<p>It is surprizing, yet very true, that, in these contested times, the papal
power was pushed very near its greatest height. The materials, indeed,
were formed and collected some time before. A multitude of fictitious
decretal epistles had been forged in the names of the antient popes, so early
as from the year 800, all tending to exalt the bishop of Rome, as head over
the church universal; but these were not as yet generally known and received
as laws, the church being hitherto governed by collections of canons
made by private persons, out of the canons of the general or provincial
councils and sayings of the fathers. But in the reign of our Stephen, the
mighty fabrick began to be reared, and to take a regular form. Gratian, a
Roman courtier, undertook to make a new compilation of ecclesiastical laws,
and published it under the name of <i>Decretum</i>, which is now the first volume
of the canon law. This is a motely composition, digested under distinct
heads or titles, of rules and decisions, collected from the sayings of the
fathers, canons of the councils, and, above all, from the decretal epistles
of the popes, (the modern ones real, the ancient ones forged), and was put
together principally for the two great purposes, of aggrandising the See of
Rome, and exempting the clergy from lay-jurisdiction. And, for that purpose,
not only forged epistles and canons have been inserted in it, but the
real canons and writings of the fathers have been, in many places, falsified
by adding or omitting words as best served the purpose proposed; and
that this is the case of Gratian’s work, the learned Papists themselves confess,
in many instances. However, in that ignorant age, it passed easily all
for genuine. But the popes, wisely considering, that, if it was canvassed, it
would not bear a strict scrutiny, never chose to give it an authentic testimony<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
of their authority, but contented themselves with authorising it to
be read in universities. In the interval I have mentioned, the popes began
to turn their spiritual arms of excommunication or interdict, that is, forbidding
the administration of divine offices, except in <i>articulo mortis</i>, in a
country or district, to temporal purposes, and the support of their grandeur<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<p>On this state of affairs happened the quarrel between the archbishop and
Henry, which embroiled him with the pope, embittered his life, and was
attended with consequences that brought him to the grave with sorrow. At
this time there were two popes, Victor, confirmed by the emperor, and
Alexander, the most enterprising pope the world had yet seen, supported by
the king of France. Had Henry followed the example of William, and acknowledged
neither, he might have kept both in awe, and vindicated the
rights of his crown with success. But he was prevailed upon by Lewis of
France to recognize Alexander, who was afterwards made an instrument
of humbling Henry, of whose power that monarch was jealous. For his extreme
partiality and severity is, in part, to be ascribed to the influence of
his protector, as well as to his zeal for ecclesiastical immunities. These
immunities had grown to an excessive height, and, under the pretence that
no man should be twice punished for one offence, the bishops took care to
inflict penance on ecclesiastical offenders, and then refused to suffer them
to be tried by the laws of the land; so that the most profligate ruffians
crowded into the lower order, and committed with impunity (except penance,
or rather, a pecuniary commutation for it) what murders, rapes,
and robberies, they thought fit. Henry was sensible of those enormities,
and, in hopes of curing them, by the assistance of one highly obliged to him,
got Becket, who was lord chancellor, his favourite, and indebted to him
for his grandeur, promoted to the See of Canterbury. But he soon found
how much he was mistaken in his man. Becket had been bred in his
youth in the study of the ecclesiastical laws, and, though he had in all
things hitherto complied with the king for his advancement, was, at the
bottom, strictly attached to his order and its privileges, and resolved, at
whatever price, rather to extend than diminish them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>To dazzle the people, he threw aside the pomp and expensive life of a
courtier, and assumed the character of mortification and sanctity. He began
by reclaiming the estates belonging formerly to his see, though they had
been aliened by his predecessors, with the consent of their chapters, and
upon valuable consideration; and this under pretence of a canon, made a
year or two before by Pope Alexander, in a packed council at Troyes in
France; which was plainly saying, that an ecclesiastical canon might repeal
the laws of any country, and subvert its constitution. He made an attempt
likewise on the patronages of laymen, and appointed a parson to a church,
which belonged to one of his own tenants, and afterwards excommunicated
the tenant for turning this person out, altho’ he was the king’s tenant <i>in capite</i>;
and such, by a law of the conqueror, were forbid to be excommunicated
without the king’s leave, under the penalties of treason. This was a
very necessary law; as otherwise a bishop might, by his sentence, deprive
the king of his service, and that of as many of his military tenants as he
pleased. However, in this point, when he found he was in danger of being
prosecuted on the law, he relented, and absolved the gentleman<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>.</p>

<p>His screening of criminals was excercised also in the most shameful manner.
A lewd clerk had debauched a young lady, and afterwards publickly
murdered her father, and this criminal was refused to be given up to be
tried. Another was guilty of sacrilege, in stealing a silver chalice out of a
church, and <i>Becket</i> would not suffer him to be tried by the laws of the land.
However, as the offence concerned the church, and was therefore of a very
heinous nature, he tried him himself; and having found him guilty, branded
him with a hot iron, in defiance both of the English and canon laws,
neither of which allow such punishments to an ecclesiastical judge. But he
knew he was too faithful a servant to the Pope, to be called to an account
even for making free with his own law.</p>

<p>Henry, finding it necessary to stop the prelate’s career, summoned an assembly
of the bishops, and demanded of them that they should degrade all
ecclesiastical murderers, and deliver them over to the secular arm. At first
the majority seemed to think this a reasonable proposal, as they must, in
the first place, find them guilty before they were to be given up. But <i>Becket</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
brought them over, by representing, that, by the canon law, they were not
to be concerned in matters of blood, and that their delivering over any criminal
to capital punishment would be infringing thereof. They therefore refused
the king. He then demanded whether they would observe the laws
and customs of the kingdom. Their answer was, in all things that did not
interfere with the rights of their order. The king left the assembly in
wrath, and at length, Becket was, by the intreaties of the other bishops,
and even of the Pope’s legate, who knew his master, being embroiled
with the antipope, was not able, at this time, to support him, prevailed
with to wait on the king, and promise to observe the laws of the land without
any reservation<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.</p>

<p>Henry, sensible that such a general promise, when particular facts arose,
might be explained and evaded, was resolved that the limits of the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction should be ascertained in such a manner as would leave no
room for subterfuges; and to that end called a parliament at Clarendon,
wherein Becket and the bishops swore to observe the laws there made, called
<i>constitutions</i>, as new laws, but declared to be the old laws of the realm.
These constitutions were in number sixteen. I shall mention a few of the
principal, in order to give a notion of the points of jurisdiction then contested
between the spiritual and lay courts. First, then, it was declared, that
suits about presentations to livings belong to the king’s courts; that clergymen
should be tried for temporal crimes in the temporal courts; and that,
if they pleaded guilty, or were convicted, they should lose the ecclesiastical
privilege; that no clergyman should quit the realm without the king’s
licence, nor attain it, without giving security to attempt nothing to the prejudice
of the king or kingdom; that no immediate tenant, or officer of the
crown, should be excommunicated without the king’s licence; that appeals
in ecclesiastical causes should be made from the arch-deacon to the bishop,
from the bishop to the archbishop, from the archbishop to the king.</p>

<p>This indeed was striking at the root of the Pope’s supremacy, and of
his profits too. It was in truth declaring the king supreme head of the
church as to jurisdiction; next, that all that held ecclesiastical dignities by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
the tenure of baronies, should do the duty of barons, and among the rest
sit in judgment as barons; however with this favourable allowance to them,
in consideration of their being bound by the canon law, that they might retire
when the question was to be put about loss of life or limb; likewise
that no bishop, or abbot, should be elected without the king’s consent;
nor, when elected, be consecrated till they had first done homage and
fealty; that the spiritual courts should not hold plea of debts due upon oath;
and lastly, that the spiritual and temporal courts should mutually aid each
other in carrying their sentences into execution<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>.</p>

<p>Such were the most material of the famous constitutions of Clarendon
drawn from the antient practice, and law of the kingdom, which the Pope
afterwards declared null and void, as contrary to the rights of the holy
church; which was plainly assuming the supreme legislature in every thing
that had the most distant relation to a church, or a churchman. But Becket,
who had sworn to obey the old laws only, for fear of personal danger at that
time, did not wait for the Pope’s condemnation of them, but instantly
shewed he was resolved to disobey, by enjoining himself penance, and abstaining
from officiating till he could obtain the Pope’s absolution. Henry,
provoked to the uttermost, was now resolved to crush him. He called
him to an account in parliament for all the king’s moneys that had passed
through his hands while he was chancellor, and for one thousand marks he
had lent him; demands that the king had never intended to have made,
but for his refractoriness; and which he well knew he was not able to pay,
having embezzled them in high living.</p>

<p>The archbishop resolved to stand out to extremity: he offered a most
wonderful plea in a cause merely civil, that of debt, <i>viz.</i> that his being made
archbishop of Canterbury had discharged him of all former accounts and
debts, and appealed, even in this purely civil cause, to the Pope. When
reproached with contravening the constitutions of Clarendon, contrary to
his oath, he broached another curious maxim, That, in every oath a clergyman
could take, there was a <i>tacit salvo</i> for the rights of his order; he forbid
the bishop to sit in judgment upon him, under pain of excommunication.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
He would not hear his sentence, but told the peers that he was their father,
and they his children, and that children had no right to sit in judgment on
their father. He then departed, in contempt of the court, and went over
to France, where he was kindly received by that king; and the Pope avowed
and encouraged him in all the extravagances he had advanced, received his
appeal, and annulled all sentences against him.</p>

<p>However, as the schism was not yet ended, he kept him in for some
time from proceeding to extremities; but as soon as the danger was over,
the Pope suffered him to thunder out his excommunications against all the
ministers of the king, and all that observed the constitutions of Clarendon.
The king himself, indeed, was spared, and the kingdom was not, on this occasion,
laid under an interdict; a circumstance then much apprehended.
The king, on the other hand, enacted, that no appeals should be made to
the archbishop, or Pope; that the lands belonging to Becket should be confiscated;
that the clergy who resided abroad should return in three months,
or forfeit their benefices; and that no letter of interdict should be brought
into England, the penalty of which last was afterwards made the same of
treason.</p>

<p>The king was not a little uneasy at the apprehensions of personal excommunication,
or of an interdict’s issuing, as he observed the censures already
passed had but too much influence on the weakness of many of his subjects.
He therefore, to ward the blow, had recourse to negotiation, which the
Pope readily admitted, who feared, on the other hand, from the popularity
of Henry’s and the unpopularity of Becket’s conduct, that his ecclesiastical
thunders might be slighted in England. He contrived, however, in the
interim, to embroil him with the king of France, and other powers on the
continent. Matters continued on this footing for some years, in a train of
negotiation; in the course of which the moderation of the king and the insolence
of the archbishop were equally remarkable, till, at length, the former,
finding the Pope had trod down all opposition, and that his own interest
was on the decline, was obliged, I may say, to submit; for he was reconciled
to Becket; engaged to restore his and his adherent’s effects, and to
suffer him to return to England, which he did with the additional quality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
of legate of the Pope; and no mention was made of either side, of the subject
of the dispute.</p>

<p>But Becket was resolved to shew the world he had conquered. He began
the exercise of his legatine power, by suspending and degrading the
clergy, and excommunicating the laity that adhered to the laws of the kingdom.
Nay, he excommunicated two of the king’s tenants for cutting off
the tail of his sumpter mule; so sacred was the beast become.</p>

<p>Soon after he was murdered at the high altar, in consequence of a rash
speech of the king’s, in a barbarous manner, as all, any way acquainted
with the history of England, must know; and now was Henry compleatly
at the Pope’s mercy. For Becket, dead, served the See of Rome more effectually
than he ever could have done living. The bloodiness of the fact,
the sacredness of the place where it was committed, and the resolution with
which he died, filled not only all England, but all Europe, with religious
horror. Miracles in abundance he immediately wrought, and he who by
many was looked upon as a traitor, was now universally esteemed a saint
and a martyr; and so he was to the interest of the See of Rome.</p>

<p>In these circumstances Henry was obliged to submit to be judged by the
Pope’s legates, who, at length, absolved him, on his swearing that he had
not willingly occasioned the murder, and that he felt great grief and vexation
on account of it; in which, no doubt, he was sincere. But before he
could obtain it, he was obliged to promise to be faithful to Alexander and
his successors, not to interrupt the free course of appeals to Rome in ecclesiastical
causes, and not to enforce the observance of evil customs introduced
since his accession to the throne; for so they stiled the constitutions of Clarendon,
though they were only declarations of the old law. And thus
ended this famous contest, in an absolute victory on the side of the Pope<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>.</p>

<p><i>The rebellions of Henry’s sons—He is succeeded by Richard</i> I.—<i>The steps taken
at this period towards settling the succession to the kingdom—The laws of Oleron—Accession
of John—His cruelty and oppressions.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Henry’s quarrel with the Pope, terminating in the manner it did,
necessarily weakened the weight and influence he ever before supported,
both in his own kingdom, and on the continent; nor could the
unwearied pains he afterwards took, in redressing grievances, and making
salutary laws, by the advice of his parliament, restore him to the consequence
he had lost. The rest of his life was spent in unfortunate wars with his rebellious
children, instigated thereto by the artful Philip of France. And the
pretence was grounded on a step that Henry had taken in favour of his children,
and I may add of his people, that of bringing the crown to a regular
course of succession, and by that means preventing contests upon a vacancy.
Hugh Capet, the first of the present race of French kings, who came to the
throne by election, in order to perpetuate it in his family, invented that
practice which his successors followed for near three hundred years, of associating
the eldest son, by causing him to be crowned in the father’s lifetime.</p>

<p>Henry, who loved his children, and was sensible that the not following
this practice in England had occasioned the wars between William and
Henry the Conqueror’s sons, and their brother Robert, as well as those
between Stephen and himself and his mother, crowned his eldest son
Henry. But the use which the ungrateful prince made of his advancement,
was to embroil his father, by demanding the immediate cession of
Normandy, on pretence that, being a king, he should have some country
given up immediately to govern. Upon young Henry’s death, the father,
who knew Richard, with greater capacity, was equally unnatural with his
elder brother, resolved not to give him the same pretence to trouble him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
and refused obstinately to have him crowned; but this refusal served itself
for a pretext for rebellion, as it gave Richard room to think, or at least to
pretend to think, that his father intended to disinherit him, and to settle the
crown on his youngest and favourite son John. In this rebellion Richard,
assisted by the king of France, and many of Henry’s subjects, who probably
suspected Henry’s design was such as was suggested, prevailed, and the
father was obliged to engage that his subjects should take the oath of eventual
allegiance to Richard, and soon after died of a broken heart, occasioned
by the undutiful conduct of every one of his sons.</p>

<p>Richard accordingly succeeded; during whose reign we have little to
observe concerning the laws, the whole time of it being spent in a continual
state of war either in Palestine or France. Enormously heavy indeed were
the taxations his subjects laboured under, and yet they bore them with chearfulness.
For the holy war, and the recovery of the sepulchre of Christ from
the infidels, no aids could be thought exorbitant; and for his wars after his
return he was readily supplied out of affection; for the remorse he shewed
for having occasioned his father’s death, his admirable valour, the injustice
of and the cruel treatment he received in his captivity, and, above all, the
opposition between the perfidious conduct of the French king and his openness
and sincerity, endeared him to his subjects, made them shut their eyes
on his many failings, and bear their burthens with patience.</p>

<p>Two things only passed in this reign proper for the subject of these lectures,
the steps made for settling the succession of the crown, and the
laws of Oleron. As Richard was unmarried when he set out for Palestine,
he thought it proper to prevent, if he could, any doubt that might arise,
in case he died without issue. There might, in this case, be two competitors,
Arthur, the son of Geoffry, his next brother who was dead, and
John the youngest brother, who was living. However clear the point is at
this day in favour of the nephew, it was then far otherwise. For Arthur
might be urged the right of representation. He represented his father
Geoffry; in all the fiefs in France, the law was in favour of the nephew;
nay, Glanville, who wrote in Henry the Second’s reign in
England, as to English estates, declared to the same purpose; and certain it
is that the general current of opinions at that time tended that way<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>On the other side, it might be said in favour of John’s pretensions, that
the examples of fiefs could be no precedents in case of crowns. These required
more strictly, a person capable of acting in person. That this was
the very case; John was a man, Arthur a child; that, allowing Glanville
to have laid down the law right, he had made a distinction, which comes up
to this case; for he says, the uncle shall succeed, if the father of the nephew
had in his life-time been <i>forisfamiliated</i>; that Geoffry had been out of the
<i>patria potestas</i> of Henry, by being sovereign prince of Britany; that in the
Saxon times two cases, for the exclusion of infants, had happened, much
stronger than the present; that when Edmund the first died in possession of
the throne, his brother Edred succeeded, not his sons; and though Edmund
Ironside had been king, yet, after the Danish usurpation ceased, his
brother the <i>Confessor</i> was preferred to his son, though of full age, whereas
Geoffry never had the crown; that, since the conquest, three several times
had the lineal succession been set aside by parliament. So that there were
not wanting plausible arguments of each side of the question, and it is with
injustice that modern historians, considering only the maxims of their own
times, when a regular succession has been established, charge John with a
manifest usurpation of the crown of England. But that he was a manifest
usurper of the territories in France must be allowed; for, by the laws of
that country, they should have gone to the nephew.</p>

<p>A question of this weight and difficulty should regularly have been
decided in parliament, which always hitherto had determined in such matters;
but Richard had never thought of the business till he left England,
and then it was too late to proceed in that method. He was obliged, therefore,
to content himself with declaring, by his own authority, his nephew
Arthur his successor; and, to prevent John’s traversing his design, he exacted
an oath from him not to set foot in England for three years; but from
this obligation he afterwards released him, at the request of their mother.
John used all his art to caress the nobility, and to supplant his nephew Arthur,
as he fondly hoped Richard would never return. And indeed, the
conduct of William Longchamp, bishop of Ely, Richard’s viceroy, contributed
greatly to his success; for, as to oppressions and outrages, he was not
exceeded even by William Rufus himself. This gave John a pretext for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
intermeddling to preserve the liberties of the people. He sent word to that
prelate, that if he did not refrain from his exorbitancies, he would visit him
at the head of an army; which for such an occasion he might easily raise.</p>

<p>A general assembly, or parliament, was called, to compose the differences;
in which it was settled, that Longchamp should continue in the
administration, and hold the castles during the king’s life, but that, if he
died without issue, they should be delivered to John as successor; and this
agreement was ratified by the oaths of all the nobility and prelates, so that,
as Arthur had the decision of the king in his favour, John by this means
attained that of the people. Sensible how much this step must offend the
king, and of the dangerous predicaments he must stand in should he return,
he spared no pains to ascend the throne even in the life of his brother, in
which he was cordially supported by the king of France. But all his efforts
were baffled by the vigilance of the regency, who had been appointed on
Longchamp’s deposition, and was more necessary from his continuing in his
former extravagancies. John even gave out that Richard was dead, and
seized several castles, which he put in a state of defence. He was, however,
soon reduced, upon the king’s return, and all his treasonable practices
pardoned at the intercession of his mother. When Richard came to
die, he changed his mind as to Arthur, and by will appointed John his
successor: an alteration, considering his former attachments to his nephew,
who had never offended him, that could proceed from nothing but his
unwillingness to leave his dominions involved in a civil war through the
intrigues and interest of his brother.</p>

<p>The laws of Oleron concerning naval affairs are the only specimen of
this prince’s legislative capacity. They were made at the isle of Oleron,
off the coast of France, where his fleet rendezvoused in their passage to the
Holy Land, and were designed for the keeping of order, and the determination
of controversies abroad. With such wisdom were these laws framed,
that they have been adopted by other nations as well as England. And, I
think, to this time we may, with probability enough, refer the origin of the
admiralty jurisdiction. In his reign, for the first and the last time, was
raised the feudal aid, for the redemption of the king from captivity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the faults of this prince, his firmness against the
papal power is to be commended. Two of his bishops having a controversy,
there was an appeal to the pope, who sent a legate to determine it; but
Richard prevailed on the parties to refer it to his arbitration, and would
not suffer the legate to enter England, till he had made an end of the business;
and when he did come, the king suffered him not to excercise his
legatine power in any but one single point, and that by his express permission.
Notwithstanding all the steps taken in favour of John, in order to
pave the way for his succession, the notion of Arthur’s hereditary right had
taken such strong root in the minds of many, that, had he been in England,
and of a sufficient age to manage his affairs, he might have had a fair prospect
of success<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>.</p>

<p>The lower people indeed were easily prevailed on by his agents to take
the oath of fealty to John, while the prelates, and nobility in general, retired
to their castles, as deliberating what steps they should take; but, at
length, by magnificent grants, and more magnificent promises, they were
prevailed on to come in, and he mounted the throne without opposition.
But in the French provinces his usurpation met with more resistance. Arthur
had many partizans, and his cause was espoused by Philip of France,
the lord paramount, not with an intention to strip John of all; for that,
with Britany, would have made Arthur too powerful; but with a design to
divide the dominions more equally between them, and perhaps to clip off
a part for himself, as he afterwards did Normandy, as being forfeited by a
sentence of the peers of France, by John’s murder of Arthur. By the way,
I shall observe, that this sentence was notoriously unjust. By the laws of
France, Arthur was the undoubted heir of Normandy, and on his death his
sister ought to have succeeded, nor ought the duchy to have been forfeited
by the crime of a wrongful possessor. Or, taking it the other way, that
Philip had a right to choose his vassal, and, consequently, that the investiture
he gave to John was valid; then was he rightful duke of Normandy,
and Arthur, as duke of Britany, was his vassal, and had justly forfeited his
life, by rebelling and endeavouring to depose his liege lord. That John
was guilty of this crime there was no room to doubt; and truly, from the
whole of his conduct from that time, he seemed to have been infatuated by
the terrors of his conscience; for it was but little less than frenzy. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
knew he was, by this cruel act, become the detestation of his subjects in
general, and that his father, in the midst of his power and popularity, had
been humbled by the Pope; and yet, at the same time, he trampled on the
liberties of the former, and oppressed them in the most outrageous manner,
and while his subjects were thus disaffected, he openly set the latter at
defiance.</p>

<p>To this reign, however, so inglorious, and so miserable to the English of
that age, do their successors owe the ascertaining their liberties. He was,
if we except William Rufus, the first of the kings that openly professed to
rule by arbitrary power. I do not mean to deny that every one of his predecessors
from the Conquest had, in some particular or other encroached
on their people, but then there were either peculiar circumstances of distress,
that almost enforced and excused them, or one or two wrong steps
were atoned for by the greatness and goodness of their general conduct. It
is very observable, that, as England is almost the only country in Europe
that hath preserved its liberties, so was it the first wherein the kings set up
for absolute power: and the preservation of them, I apprehend, was in a
great measure owing thereto, that this claim was started there when the feudal
principles, and the spirit of independency, except only in feudal matters,
were in their vigour, and consequently raised such a spirit of jealousy
and watchfulness, as, though it hath sometimes slept, could never be extinguished;
whereas, in other countries, the progress of arbitrary power hath
been more gradual. It hath made its advances when the feudal system was
in its wane, and when the minds of men, by the introduction of the civil
and canon law, were prepared for it.</p>

<p>What encouraged the kings of England to attempt this sooner than
other monarchs, we may judge, was the greater disparity in riches between
them and their vassals, than was in other countries; so that nothing much
less than a general confederacy could curb them; whereas, abroad, two or
three potent vassals were an overmatch for the sovereign. Besides, having
subjects on each side of the water, not knit together in any common interest,
they might hope to use the one to quell the other. But whatever was the
cause, so was the fact; and John, even before the death of Arthur, having
removed the dread of a competitor, shewed, by a most extraordinary step,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
what kind of sovereign he was like to prove. By the law of these days a
vassal was to pay his relief to his superior out of his own demesnes, and the
profits of his seignory, and had no right to demand aid for that purpose
from his sub-vassals; John having detached Philip from his nephew’s interest,
by ceding a part of his French territories, was to pay twenty thousand
marks for the relief of the rest; and, to receive this sum, he, by his own
authority, laid three shillings on every hide of land in England; thus
making England to pay that relief for his foreign dominions, which his
foreign subjects themselves were not obliged to pay.</p>

<p>The next instance was in favour of the Pope, under pretence of the holy
war. Innocent had laid a tax upon the clergy, of the fortieth of their revenues,
and sent a collector to England to gather it, whom John, of his own authority,
empowered to collect it from the laity. These two impositions were
submitted to, in as much as there was no plan of opposition then formed;
but they afterwards occasioned great discontent among a people, who thought
no taxes could be raised without their own consent. Accordingly, the next
time he summoned his military tenants to attend him into France, they assembled
at Leicester, and agreed to refuse attendance, unless he would restore
their privileges; for though, by the law of the Conqueror, they were obliged
to go, they looked upon this obligation as suspended by his behaviour.
However, they had not yet sufficiently smarted, to unite them thoroughly,
and this affair was made up by his accepting a scutage.</p>

<p>To enumerate all the exorbitancies he committed would be tedious, and
unnecessary, as the remedies prescribed in <i>Magna Charta</i> sufficiently point
out the grievances. Let it suffice to say, in general, that he oppressed his
military tenants by exacting extravagant reliefs, by disparagement of heirs,
by wasting his wards lands, by levying exorbitant scutages, by summoning
them to war, and delaying them so long at the place of transportation that
they were obliged to return home, having spent all their money; or, when
they were transported, keeping them inactive till they were obliged to return
for the same reason, and then, without trial, seizing their lands as forfeited.
The same oppressions he extended to others, seized lands and tenements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
at will and pleasure, imprisoned whom he pleased, laid heavy talliages
on the socage tenants and boroughs, without any regard to the privileges
they had obtained from his predecessors; and having, by these means
excited the detestation of his subjects, and forfeited his reputation by losing
Normandy by his indolence, he took it into his head that he was a match
for the Pope, and engaged in a contest with his Holiness, which subjected
him and his kingdom to the Roman See, tho’ eventually it contributed not
a little to the recovery of his subjects liberties.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> The manner in which this
happened shall be the subject of the ensuing lecture.</p>

</div>

<p>If Alexander the Third shewed the grandeur of the pontifical power in
humbling Henry the Second, the displaying it in its full glory was reserved
for Innocent the Third who now reigned, and who being promoted to the
papacy at the age of thirty seven, had vigour of body and mind to carry
every point he engaged in, and was resolved to push his power to the utmost.
Having tasted the sweets of English gold, in the collection made under pretence
of the holy war, he had a great desire to renew the experiment; and
that he might be able to proceed with the less opposition, was resolved to
have an archbishop of Canterbury at his devotion; and the See falling vacant,
a controverted election furnished him with an opportunity.</p>

<p>The election belonged to the convent of Christ-church, though it was
contested with them by the suffragan bishops. The very night the archbishop
died, a faction of the younger monks resolving to have an archbishop
of their own chusing, assembled, and chose Reginald sub-prior of the
convent, and sent him off before morning for Rome, to obtain the Pope’s
confirmation, of which they did not entertain any doubt, as it would be
plucking a feather from the king’s prerogative, that of a previous licence
for proceeding to election; and Innocent had already shewn that he looked
on himself as monarch of monarchs. But as they could not expect the
Pope would take this stride in support of a clandestine election, they all
took an oath of secrecy, to be observed till the confirmation was obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>But Reginald’s vanity defeated the scheme, and made him divulge it,
which so provoked his electors, that they joined with the others, petitioned
the king for a license, and elected, at his recommendation, the bishop of
Norwich, and twelve of the monks were dispatched to solicit his confirmation.
The suffragan bishops opposed him, as being elected without their
concurrence, which point was determined for the convent by Innocent;
notwithstanding which, without assigning any invalidity in the second election,
he annulled it as well as the first, and recommended to the twelve deputies
to elect Stephen Langton, an Englishman and a cardinal. At
first they demurred, as having no authority; but the threat of instant excommunication
compelled them to obey. And then, as if they had done
nothing out of the way, he recommended Langton to John in a very civil
letter. The king, enraged to the highest, turned the monks of Canterbury,
who were entirely innocent, out of their convent and the kingdom, and
threatened the Pope that he would suffer no appeals. Innocent, who had
before this humbled Philip of France by an interdict, and knew the man
he had to deal with, proceeded very calmly, to order three bishops to
exhort the king to receive Langton, and recall the monks; and, in case
of non-compliance, to lay the kingdom under an interdict<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.</p>

<p>The name of interdict frightened John, who knew how much he was
hated. He offered to comply, if he might be allowed to make a protestation
of a saving his dignity and prerogative; but no salvo would be allowed;
the interdict was published, Divine service ceased through the kingdom,
except in a very few places, where some clergymen were found honest and
bold enough to preach against the Pope’s proceedings. John, in revenge,
fleeced the clergy in a most horrible manner; and, what is yet more surprising,
did not desist from oppressing the laity. However, as to the points
in contest, he was not obstinate; he offered more than once to submit;
but Innocent had more extensive views. There was no remission without
he refunded to the churchmen every farthing he had extorted from them,
a thing absolutely out of his power. Then followed, after successive delays
calculated to shew that the holy father would give his undutiful son time
to repent, a sentence of excommunication by name, a bull absolving his
subjects from their oath of allegiance, and commanding all persons to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
avoid his company; and, lastly, a sentence of deposition, and a grant of all
his dominions to the king of France, who had been invited also by John’s
subjects, whose patience had been by this time quite exhausted with his
tyranny, and the suspension of the performance of Divine service.</p>

<p>Philip was very ready to execute this sentence, and assembled a numerous
army. Randulf was sent, as the Pope’s legate, to see the sentence of
deposition put in execution; but, in reality, with secret instructions of a
very different nature; for it was by no means Innocent’s intention to give
England to France, but to subject it to himself. John, terrified with the
exaggerated account of Philip’s armament, and the disaffection of his subjects,
submitted in every point before in contest, and in one new one, that
no clergyman should be outlawed. But this was not sufficient to avert
the danger from Philip, and his own disaffected barons. To make
him sacred and invulnerable, he became a vassal to the Pope, resigned his
kingdom to him by a formal charter, and received it again as a favour,
under homage, and a yearly rent of a thousand marks.</p>

<p>In consideration of this submission, John was favoured in the point of
indemnifying the clergy, which was what had so long retarded the accommodation.
Innocent took the estimating this on himself, and having got
all he wanted for the See of Rome, forgot his former clients the clergy,
and was very moderate with his new vassal. However, the interdict was
not removed, nor the king absolved from his excommunication, till Langton
was put into possession; which when done, John was obliged to renew
his homage, to swear to defend church and clergy against all their adversaries,
and to make restitution; and then he was absolved. But there
was one curious addition to this oath, which Langton, who was an Englishman,
and a lover of liberty, certainly inserted of his own head, that he
should restore the laws of the Confessor: For Innocent would never, we
may be well assured, have allowed such privileges to his vassals. John,
however, out of fear of Philip, being in an hurry to be absolved, made no
objection; and indeed he had no reason to doubt the Pope would absolve
him from his oath. But Langton and the nobles were resolved to keep
him strictly to it. Soon after, while he was in France, his regents summoned
a parliament, wherein the king’s peace was proclaimed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
laws of Henry the First were revived. These were those he had sworn to
restore, being in truth the Confessor’s, with a few additions and alterations
by the Conqueror and Henry.</p>

<p>John, however, went on in his old courses, being now sure of the Pope’s
protection, and indeed it was hard to charge him with a breach of Henry’s
charter, of which, though copies had been lodged in every cathedral and
great abbey in England, yet so carefully were they destroyed, that not one
appeared. At length archbishop Langton furnished them with one, which
had escaped the general calamity; and this the associated barons, who had
determined to restrain John, and recover their liberties, made the basis of
their demands, and swore to demand, and if refused, to vindicate with
the sword, at a meeting they had at Edmundsbury under pretence of
devotion. Accordingly, they waited on the king in a military dress, and
made their demands; but he, seeing they were only a party among the
nobles, and not imagining the rest were of the same sentiments, not only
refused, but with haughtiness insisted they should renounce them, by giving
under their hands and seals, that they would never make the like demand
on him or his successors. But his eyes were opened when he found
scarce two or three of those that were with him would comply. He had
recourse to procrastination, and promised them satisfaction at the latter end
of Easter. In the interim he exacted a new oath of allegiance from his
subjects; a feeble precaution; for none refused it, or thought themselves
precluded by that act of duty from vindicating their rights in what manner
they best might. To secure the clergy, he gave them a charter, confirming
their immunities, and the entire freedom of their elections; and
yet a great multitude continued zealous for the liberty of the subject against
him; but his main dependance was on religion. To render his person
sacred, he assumed the cross, as if he intended for the holy war, and implored
the protection of his Holiness, to whom the discontented barons also
represented the justice of their pretensions. Innocent, in appearance, received
them favourably, advised them to represent their hardships in a decent
and humble manner to the king, in which case he would interpose in
favour of all their just and reasonable petitions; but annulled their association,
and forbad them to enter into any new one for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>The barons, who sent to the Pope rather out of respect than any expectation
of favour, proceeded in the method they began. They and their
vassals assembled in array, in such numbers as to compose a formidable
army; and when they had particularly specified their demands, and were
refused, they proceeded to attack him, by reducing his castles. Against
himself, as being under the cross, they made no attempt. On this occasion,
archbishop Langton, who was at the bottom of the whole confederacy, outwitted
John; who, as they had disobeyed the Pope, was impatient to have
them excommunicated, and this the Pope promised to do as soon as the
foreign troops, which the king had brought over for his defence, had quitted
the kingdom; but when they were gone, he broke his engagement, so
that John, left defenceless, was obliged to appoint four nobles to treat with
the revolted lords; and, upon conference, some points they had insisted on
before being given up, the liberties of the nation were settled, as contained
in the two charters of <i>Magna Charta</i>, and <i>Charta de Foresta</i><a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>.</p>

<p>The manner of obtaining these charters, and the right the people have
to the liberties contained in them, have been the subject of much controversy
between the favourers of arbitrary power and the assertors of freedom; the
one, contending that they were the fruits of rebellion, extorted by force
and fraud, from a prince unable to resist, and therefore revocable by him
or his successors; and the others, that they were the antient privileges of the
nation, which John had, contrary to his coronation-oath, invaded, and which
they therefore had a right to reclaim by arms. That they were obtained
by force, is undoubted, and that John and many of his successors looked
upon them, therefore, as of no validity, is as clear, even from the argument
lord Coke brings for their great weight, their being confirmed above twenty
times by act of parliament. To what purpose so many confirmations, if the
kings had not thought them invalid, and had not, on occasions, broke
through them; and were it as clear that they were not the antient rights of
the people, it must be owned they were extorted by rebellion. But that
they were no other than confirmations, appears very plainly from the short
detail I have heretofore given of the constitution and spirit of the monarchy
of the Saxons, and all other northern nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<p>As to any new regulations introduced in them, as some there are, they
are only precautions for the better securing those liberties the people were
before entitled to, and it is a maxim of all laws, that he who has a right to
a thing, hath a right to the means without which he cannot enjoy that
thing.</p>

<p>The friends, therefore, to absolute power, sensible that the original constitution
is against them, choose to look no farther back than the Conquest.
Then, say they, the Saxon government and laws were extinguished, the
English by the Conquest lost their rights, the foreigners had no title to
English liberties, and the Conqueror and his son William acted as despotic
monarchs. Therefore, their successors had the same right, and it was treason
to think of controuling them. But how little foundation there is for
this doctrine, may appear from what I observed on the reign of the Conqueror.
He claimed to be king on the same footing as his predecessors; he
confirmed the Saxon laws, and consequently both Saxons and foreigners,
when settled in the kingdom, had a right to them. If he oppressed the
English, that oppression did not extend to all; and to those it did, it was
not exercised as upon conquered slaves, but as upon revolted rebels. But,
for argument sake, to allow that the English became slaves, and that the
foreign lords had no right to the Saxon privileges, both which are false,
how came the king to be despotic sovereign over them? They were partly
his own subjects, freemen, according to the feudal principles, who served
him as volunteers, for he had no right to command their service in England;
or volunteers from other princes dominions, and to say that freemen and
their posterity became slaves, because they are so kind as to conquer a kingdom
for their leader, is a most extraordinary paradox.</p>

<p>But William the Conqueror, in some instances, and his son in all, acted
as despotic princes; therefore they had a right so to do. I answer, the triumvirs
proscribed hundreds of the best Romans, therefore they had a right.
It is as unsafe to argue from matter of fact to matter of right, as from matter
of right to matter of fact. It is as absurd to say, Tarquin ruled absolutely,
therefore the Romans were rightfully his slaves, as to say the Romans
had a right to liberty under him, therefore they were free.</p>

<p>But it may be said, the people quietly submitted, and new rights may be
acquired, and new laws made, by the tacit consent of prince and people, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
well as by express legislation. I allow it where the consent is undoubtedly
voluntary, and hath continued uninterrupted for a long space of time; and
how voluntary this submission was, we may judge from the terms they
made with Henry the First, before they suffered him to mount the throne.
Besides, there are some points of liberty, essential to human nature, that
cannot, either by express or tacit laws, be given up, such as the natural
right that an innocent man has to his life, his personal liberty, and the
guidance of his actions, provided they are lawful, when the public good
doth not necessarily require a restraint. In short, never was there a worse
cause, or worse defended; and this maxim was what influenced the conduct
of the Stuarts, and precipitated that unhappy house to their ruin.</p>

<p>John, who entertained the same sentiments, had no resource to recover
his lost rights, as he thought them, but the assistance of the Pope, and an
army of foreigners. The first very cordially espoused his interest. He was
provoked that he, who had humbled kings, should be controuled by petty
lords, and that by these privileges he should be prevented from reaping
that golden harvest he expected from England. He annulled the charters,
commanded them to recede from them, and, on their disobedience, excommunicated
them, first in general, and then, by name.</p>

<p>About the same time arrived an army of veteran foreigners, that came
to assist John, who had, in imitation of the Conqueror, distributed to them
the estates of the barons. With these and a few English lords, he took
the field, and ravaged the country with a more than Turkish barbarity. The
confederate barons saw the liberties they had contended for annulled, their
lives and estates in the most imminent danger, and, in a fit of despair, invited
Lewis, prince of France, to the crown, who, bringing over an army,
saved them from immediate destruction. However, this strengthened John.
It was not for any to stand neuter. Few chose to embark in an excommunicated
party, and many, who saw slavery unavoidable, and nothing left
but the choice of a master, preferred their countryman for a king to a foreigner.
The loss of liberty now seemed certain, which ever prevailed;
when the haughtiness of Lewis, and his want of confidence in the English
noblemen who joined him, concurring with the death of John, and the
innocence of his infant son, providentially preserved the freedom of
England.</p>

canon law—Confirmation of Magna Charta—A commentary on Magna
Charta, in so far as it relates to what now is law.</i></p>

</div>

<p>John left his minor son under the guardianship of the earl of Pembroke,
a nobleman of great abilities, and the strictest integrity. The
first step he took for the benefit of his pupil, was the confirmation of the
charters, and the next was a negotiation with the revolted lords, who began
to be discontented with the prince of France; which succeeded so happily,
that in a short time he brought them all over with very little bloodshed,
and Lewis was obliged to quit the kingdom. Peace being re-established,
the regent applied himself with all diligence to restore the peace of the kingdom,
and justice to her regular course: And had he lived long enough to
form the conduct and principles of the young king, England never had
a fairer prospect of happiness; but he soon dying, and his successors being
men of a different stamp, such principles were sown in the monarch’s mind,
as, in the event, produced bitter fruit both to him and the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>This reign was as calamitous as the preceeding one, and rather more
shameful; and what added to the misfortune, it lasted three times as long.
As soon as Henry came of age, he revoked <i>Magna Charta</i>, as being, an act
of his nonage, soon after he confirmed it, then broke it, then confirmed it
by oath, with a solemn excommunication of all that should infringe it;
then he obtained from the Pope a dispensation of his oath, and broke it
again. And thus he fluctuated for fifty years, according as his hopes or
years prevailed. However, in general, the charter was pretty well observed.
The great point it was infringed in, was the levying money without
the parliament, and in this he frequently prevailed, being assisted by his
Lord Paramount, the Pope. They joined in levying taxes, and then divided
the spoil between them. Indeed, their Holinesses had, upon each occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
by much the greater share; for they not only fleeced the clergy separately,
but drew vast sums from the king, on pretence of a foolish project
of making his younger son king of Sicily; all which they squandered on
their private occasions.</p>

<p>In this reign they introduced the practice of provisorship, against which
so many acts of parliament have been made. It went on this maxim, That
the Pope was universal pastor of the church, and consequently sole judge
who should be his deputy in any particular place. The inference necessarily
followed, that the rights of patronage to livings, whether in a Bishop or
lay patron, were, strictly speaking, no rights at all, being such only where
the Pope did not chuse to interfere. But this privilege would have been of
little significance, if they could act only in the vacancy of a living; for it
would generally have been filled up before he could have notice. Bulls of
provisorships were, therefore, invented. These were charters of the Pope,
directed to the bishop, acquainting him, that he had provided for such a
person, by appointing him to such a benefice, when it should become vacant,
or the first benefice of such a value that should fall; strictly forbidding
the Bishop to admit any other person, upon any account whatsoever.
Sometimes the person provided for was not named; but notice was to be given
when the vacancy happened. In process of time a number of livings
were resolved in the same bull; nay, one went so far as to forbid any living
that should fall to be filled, till the Pope had provided for three hundred persons.
Such were the delightful consequences of John’s homage, and of
England becoming St. Peter’s patrimony; so that the monkish historians
tell us that Rome sheared all Europe; but in England they flayed off the
skin. An account was taken at one time of the value of English benefices possessed
by Italian priests, non-residents, and it was found to exceed the ordinary
revenue of the crown. All these bulls concluded with a non obstante,
that is, notwithstanding any laws, custom, privilege, right or patronage, or
any thing else whatever; and this hopeful precedent Henry the Third adopted
in his charters, thereby, if he could not repeal, at least making ineffectual
the laws of the land; and thus began the king’s claiming a <i>dispensing
power</i> over the laws<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span></p>

<p>In this meridian of the Pope’s power was the canon law introduced
into England, and it soon began to usurp considerably on the civil courts;
insomuch that, had not the common law judges exerted themselves to
check the ecclesiastical court by prohibitions, which they did even in
this reign, it would have gained the same ascendant that it has in the
Pope’s territory.</p>

<p>The latter end of this reign was filled with a succession of troubles, occasioned
by the repeated breaches of the charters, and fomented by the ambition
of some of the great nobles; however, in the end, the king prevailed,
by the assistance of his son; but it was found expedient, even in the midst
of victory, in order to prevent future convulsions, to establish the liberties
of England, by confirming <i>Magna Charta</i>; and they have ever since stood
their ground. I shall therefore proceed briefly to speak to <i>Magna Charta</i>,
and in so doing shall omit almost all that relates to the feudal tenures, which
makes the greatest part of it, and confine myself to that which now is
law.</p>

<p>The first chapter of <i>Magna Charta</i>, as confirmed in the 9th year of Henry,
which is that now in force, and differs from that of John in some omissions,
concerned the freedom of the church, in which was principally included
the freedom of elections to Bishopricks, which, since the reformation,
has been taken away. I shall, therefore, proceed to those that concern
the laity; the five next are feudal, and the seventh is concerning widows.
It first gives them free liberty to marry or not; whereas, before,
such as were called the <i>king’s widows</i>, that is, those who held lands, or whose
husbands held lands of the king, had been obliged to pay for license to
marry if they had a mind, or were distrained to marry, if they had no
mind, which it is unnecessary to say was a grievous oppression. It restrains
the taking any thing from the widow for her dower, or for her own land,
which her husband had held in her right. It provides for her <i>quarantine</i>,
that is, gives her leave to stay forty days in her husband’s house, unless she
had dower assigned to her before, and within that time orders the
third part of her husband’s land to be assigned her by the heir, as her
dower; and that, in the interim, she should have reasonable estovers<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span></p>

<p>The next is in favour of the <i>king’s debtors</i>, and their securities. By the
old law, the king’s profit was so highly favoured, that he could, to satisfy
his debt, seize the chattels or extend, that is, take the profits of the real
estate of his debtor, at his pleasure; or he might, in the first instance, come
on the security, without attacking the principal debtor. For remedy hereof,
it forbids the king, or any of his officers, seizing the land, while the debtor’s
personal chattels are sufficient. It forbids, also, the distraining the securities,
while the debtor’s chattels were sufficient. If they were not, the king
had the option either to seize the land of the debtor, or distrain the securities;
and if the latter was done, it provides, that the securities should have
the land, until they are reimbursed. Immediately after this, in king John’s
charter, followed the law prohibiting the king from levying any talliage or
tax on the socage tenants, or on boroughs, without assent of parliament,
which is here omitted; and this king and his son Edward asserted and exercised
the right; but the last was at length obliged to give it up, in the famous
statute <i>de tallagio non concedendo</i>, and not till then were these ranks of
the people entirely emancipated. This omission for a time rendered illusory
the next, the ninth chapter, which provides that the city of London and
all the other cities, boroughs, and ports, should enjoy all their ancient liberties
and customs; for these would be of little use whilst arbitrary taxation
remained. The tenth is in affirmance of the common law, that no person
should be distrained for more rent or services than he owed out of the land.
If he was, he had a double remedy, either by <i>a suit in replevin</i>, or by the
writ called <i>ne injuste vexes</i>. The next is for fixing the court of Common
Pleas, of which I spoke already. The twelfth was for the ease of the people,
by taking assizes in the country. But those actions are out of use
now. The thirteenth is concerning assizes too. I hasten therefore to the
fourteenth that treats of <i>amerciaments</i>.</p>

<p>Amerciaments come from the word <i>mercy</i>, and are so called from the
words in the record, <i>sit in miserecordia pro falso clamore suo</i>, and were properly,
though the word hath been since extended, what a plaintiff or defendant
that had troubled the king’s courts should pay by way of punishment
for maintaining an unjust suit; whereas <i>fines</i>, to which they bear a resemblance,
and with which they have sometimes been confounded, were for offences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
and assessed by the court; as were amerciaments also sometimes,
and very grievously, though entirely against law. This act restores the
common law; orders the amerciaments to be proportioned to the nature of
the case, and also, in regard to the man’s circumstances, so that he should
not be ruined thereby; that no freeholder should be amerced in so heavy
a manner as to destroy his freehold; no merchant, his merchandize; no
villain, his carts, whereby he would be unable to do his lord’s services; no
ecclesiastic according to the value of his benefice, but only according to his
lay property. And that this might be constantly observed, the amerciaments
were to be asserted, or settled by the man’s peers. It may be asked,
what remedy had the man, who was too severely amerced by his peers?
On this act was grounded the writ of <i>moderata miserecordia</i>, whereby this
amerciament may be tried by another jury, and moderated.</p>

<p>The fifteenth provides, that none should be distrained to repair bridges,
or landing places, but who are bound by their tenures or custom. The
sixteenth for the free navigation in rivers, and unloading of goods. The
seventeenth takes away the power of trying pleas of the crown from sheriffs,
constables and coroners, and other inferior officers; a very necessary law,
upon account of the great value of the life of an individual, especially as
none but the king’s courts could give the benefit of clergy. However,
sheriffs and coroners can take <i>indictments</i>; for that is not <i>trying</i>, but bringing
the matter into a method of trial. The eighteenth concerns debts due
to the king where his debtor is dead. By this law, the first duty of executors
is to pay the debts of the deceased; those of the highest nature, not
as to <i>value</i>, but in <i>quality</i>, in the first place, then the lower ones: and if the
effects were not sufficient, it was in their option to pay one creditor of the
same nature without another, so that they observed the rule of not paying
the lower debtor before the higher. But the king, be his debts of what
nature they would, by his prerogative, had the preference of all creditors,
and by colour hereof his officers often seized and embezzled the effects of
the deceased, to the prejudice of other creditors and legatees. This orders
the sheriff to attach and value the goods by a jury of twelve men, to
the value of the debt, which were to remain unremoved, till the king was
paid; and then the whole, or, if not, the overplus, to be restored to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
executors. The two next are feudal. The twenty-first relates to purveyorship,
which has been abolished.</p>

<p>The twenty-second relates to the king’s right to the lands of felons. On
which there is something curious to be observed. By attainder of felony,
the goods and chattels of the felon are forfeited to the king, and the land
to the lord from whom they were holden; but in case of treason, both
were forfeited to the king. Such was the feudal law; but by the law of
England, in order to deter persons from committing felony, and to make
the lords more careful what kind of tenants they chose, the king had an
interest in the land of felons; not for his own benefit indeed, but for the
terrifying by example. He had a right to commit waste in them, to cut
down the trees, to demolish the houses and improvements, and to plow
up the meadows; and for this purpose he was allowed, by common law,
a year and a day. To prevent this destruction, the lords, to whom the
land escheated frequently, by a fine, bought off the king’s right of waste;
but if they did not, his officers would take the profits for the time, and
then hold it longer, till they had committed the waste. This act prohibits
the retaining the land longer than a year and a day, and directs that then
it should be restored to the lord. This new law was certainly intended
for the public good, to prevent this malicious wasting, which the king’s
officers would be sure to commit, if they were not properly, as they
thought, considered; and to give the king, in lieu of the waste that he
had a right to make, a lawful profit, which his officers had unlawfully, to
their own use, we may be sure, extorted before. It gives the custody of
the lands for that time, and consequently the profits. But observe the
consequence.</p>

<p>The king now had the custody, as also the profits, by a legal title for a
year and a day, unless the lord pleased to compound with him, and so intitle
himself to the immediate possession. But this did not satisfy the greediness
of the officers of the crown. It was easy to gather the profits until
very near the time the king’s right expired, and then, for a week or fortnight
before it was out, they had it in their power to commit waste enough,
if the lord, who was intitled by the escheat, did not buy them out. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
was certainly against the spirit of the law whereof we are speaking, which
was intended to give the king a real profit, instead of a right destructive
to the community in general; but the waste was not prohibited expressly,
and this was pretext enough for these officers to exact composition for not
doing it within the year. It was accordingly claimed and paid, and accounted
for as due to the king, on that old maxim, That general laws do
not change the prerogative royal, but by express words. This was the
doctrine and practice in the courts of the third Henry, and convenient
enough for him, who was always indigent. But what was the opinion of
the lawyers of that age, we may learn from Bracton, Britton, and the author
of Fleta; the first of which wrote in the latter end of this reign,
and the other two in the reign following. Bracton says expressly, that
“the king’s power over the lands of felons convicted, was because he
had a right to throw down the buildings, unroot the gardens, and plow up
the meadows; but because such things turned to the great damage of the
lords, it was provided, for common utility, that such houses, gardens,
and meadows should remain, and that the king for this should have the
advantage of the whole land for a year and a day, and so every thing
should return entire to the lord. Then he goes on, but now both is
demanded, namely, a fine for the term, likewise for the waste, nor
do I see the reason why<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>.” Thus far Bracton. Britton says, speaking
in the person of the king, of felons, for in that manner his book is written,
“Their moveables are ours; their heirs are disinherited; and we will
have their tenements, of whatsoever holden, for a year and a day, so
that they shall remain in our hands that year and day, and that we shall
not cause to perish the tenements, nor hurt the woods, nor plow the
meadows, as hath been accustomed in time past<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.” Fleta talks in the
same strain, in commenting on this law of <i>Magna Charta</i>, which he expressly
quotes, that, as a mark of brand on felony, it had been antiently
provided that the houses should be thrown down, and so goes on to enumerate
the other species of waste, which I need not here repeat, as I have
mentioned them already; and then he says “because by such doings
great damage would accrue to the lords of the fiefs; for common utility
it was provided, that such hardships and severities should cease;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
and that the king, in consideration thereof, should, for a year and a
day, enjoy the commodity of the whole land; after which term it
should return to the lords of the propriety entirely, without waste or
destruction<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>.” The <i>Mirror</i>, another antient law-book, joins with these;
and this book, which was written in the same reign of Edward the first, or,
at the latest, in that of his son, says, “the point of felons lands being held
for the year is disused; for by that, the king ought not to have but the
waste by right, or the year, in name, (that is, in nature) of a fine; to save
the fief from <i>estrepement</i> (that is, waste), the ministers of the king take
both the one and the other<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>.” A melancholy consideration, that, under
his name, and in pretence of his profit, though not really to his advantage,
such a law should, for their own profit, be eluded by his ministers; as by
these testimonies, one cotemporary, and the rest immediately subsequent,
we are informed it was contrary to the intention of this chapter of <i>Magna
Charta</i>; but the practice prevailed for a long time after. I shall conclude
this lecture with the words of Lord Coke on this chapter of <i>Magna Charta</i>.
“Out of these old books you may observe, that when any thing is given
to the king, in lieu or satisfaction of <i>an antient right of his crown</i>, when
once he is in possession of the new recompence, and the same in charge,
his officers and ministers will many times demand the old also, which
may turn to great prejudice, if it be not duly and discreetly prevented<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>”.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LECTURE_XXXIX">LECTURE XXXIX.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Continuation of the commentary on Magna Charta.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The twenty-third chapter of <i>Magna Charta</i> prohibits <i>fish weires</i> in
rivers, which are great annoyances to navigation, and the free liberty
of fishing; and which have stood their ground in spite of all the laws that can
be made against them. The next relates to the inferior courts of Lords of
Manors, and to writs of <i>Præcipe in capite</i>; which having gone into disuse,
with the feudal tenures, I shall pass them over. The twenty-fifth orders,
that measures and weights should be one and the same through the whole
kingdom; witness the difference between Troy weight and Averdupois;
the wine gallon and ale gallon. Established customs, which of necessity
must come into daily practice, are hard to be rooted out by positive laws;
and indeed it is more prudent to let them continue. For the confusion that
such an alteration of things in daily or hourly practice would occasion,
would be more detrimental, for a considerable time at least, than the uniformity
intended to be introduced would be attended with advantage<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.</p>

<p>The twenty-sixth is concerning the writ <i>De odio et atia</i>, that is, of hatred
and malice; which, though not abolished, hath long since been antiquated;
but, as it was an antient provision for restoring the liberty of the
subject, I shall take some notice of it. It was a maxim of the common
law, that no man imprisoned for any offence, which, if proved, would
touch his life or members, could be bailed out but by the supreme criminal
court, the King’s Bench; which, upon danger of death, or such other special
causes as appeared sufficient to them, had that power. Hence, in
those unsettled and oppressive times, it became a practice for malicious persons
to have a man clapped up in prison for a capital offence, without
either indictment or appeal brought against him; and there he was of necessity
to lie, until the justice in eyre came into the county to deliver the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
gaols, which regularly was but once in seven years; to avoid this hardship,
the writ we are now speaking of was invented, and issued out from time to
time, as occasion required, out of the Chancery. Besides, by this chapter
of <i>Magna Charta</i>, it is ordered to be granted without any purchase or reward;
whereas, before, all the original writs were purchased at the price
the chancellor pleased to set on them, which was a grievous oppression. It
ordered the sheriff to make inquisition in the county court, by the oath of
a jury, whether the imprisonment proceeded from malice or not. If they
found it did, upon its return, the person accused had a right to a writ, ordering
the sheriff to bail him by twelve <i>manucaptors</i>, or securities. But, this
was only where there was no indictment, or appeal; for these were accusations
of record, and therefore the finding the charge malicious in the county
court, which was no court of record, could not avail against them. This,
writ has gone into disuse, since justices of gaol-delivery have continued to
go into every county twice a year; a proceeding which has evidently superseded
the necessity of it<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>The twenty-seventh chapter restrains the unjust practice in the king, of
arrogating to himself the wardship of his socage or burgage tenants, where
they held lands by military service from others, his subjects. The whole
military system hath since been dissolved by act of parliament, and therefore
it will be unnecessary for me to explain or enlarge upon the nature of
the mischief complained of in this chapter. The next forbids any judge or
officer of the king to oblige a man to <i>wage his law</i>, that is, swear to his
innocence, except in a cause where a suit was instituted against him; but
<i>wager of law</i>, being now totally fallen into disuse, I hasten to the twenty-ninth
chapter, the corner-stone of the English liberties, made in affirmance
of the old common law<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>.</p>

<p>By the bare reading of this chapter we may learn the extravagances of
John’s reign, which it was intended to redress. It consists of two parts.
The first runs thus: <i>Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut disseisetur,
de libero tenemento suo, vel libertatibus vel liberis consuetudinibus suis, aut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
utlagetur aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur, nec super eum ibimus, nec
super eum mittimus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ.</i>
First, then, to see to whom this act extends: the words <i>liber homo</i>, in antient
acts of parliament, is, in general, rightly construed <i>freeholders</i>, and so it
means here, in the second branch which prohibits disseisins; for none but
a freeholder is capable of being disseised, no others being said to have a
seisin of land. But it must not, throughout the whole of this act, be confined
to this limited sense. The first branch speaks of the restraint of liberty;
the third, of unjust outlawries; the fourth, of unjust banishment;
the fifth, of any kind of destruction, or wrongs; which, offered to an innocent
person, are against the natural rights of mankind, and therefore,
the remedy must extend to all: and so it hath always been understood;
for women are included in it, and so are villeins, for they are free men
against all but their lord.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the end of this part, which is an exception running
through the whole; <i>nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ</i>.
That is, by the common law, which doth not, in all these cases, require a
trial by peers; a thing indeed impossible, where the party doth not appear;
in which case there is a necessity of proceeding to judgment another way.
Coke observes, the words <i>legale judicium parium suorum</i> include the trial both
of lords and commons, the finding of the latter being upon oath, and called
<i>Veredictum</i>, and in which all must be unanimous; wherein it differs from
the trial of lords, for they find not upon oath, but upon honour; and it is
not necessary that all should agree, the majority, provided that majority
consists of twelve, being sufficient<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>.</p>

<p>Upon this a question may be put, who are the peers of a woman of quality?
If she be noble by blood, that is, a peeress, (for I speak not of the
nobility by courtesy, which is merely nominal) there is no doubt but the
barons and other noblemen; if she be ennobled by marrying a peer, she
becomes in law one person with her husband, and therefore must have the
same peers with him, which right continues after her husband’s death, unless
she marries a commoner; for then, being one person with him, she becomes
a commoner; whereas a peeress, in her own right, marrying a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
commoner, forfeits not her dignity, though she becomes one person with
him. She was not ennobled by her own act, and therefore, by no act of
her own can destroy that nobility she has by the gift of God, or the king,
by means of her blood, which she cannot alter.</p>

<p>Two exceptions, however, there are to the rule of every Englishman’s
being tried for offences by his peers; but neither of them against the purport
of this statute. First, the statute speaks in the disjunctive, <i>per legale
judicium parium suorum, aut per legem terræ</i>: now the <i>lex terræ</i>, the common
law, in the universal practice of it, allows these exceptions; nor will they
be found to be against the letter; for the words are <i>nec super eum ibimus</i>,
<i>nec super eum mittemus</i>, speaking in the person of the king; which shews
that it is meant of the accusation or other suit of the king. Now these exceptions
are not at his suit. One of these exceptions I mentioned in a former
lecture. It is where a commoner is impeached by the commons in
parliament; and the reason I then gave, is, I think, plain and satisfactory,
that every jury that could be summoned is supposed a party to the charge
brought by their representatives, and therefore, as the man is accused as an
enemy to the king by the body of the people, that there may not be a
failure of justice, the lords, as the only indifferent persons, must be the
judges.</p>

<p>The other exception may seem more extraordinary. It is that a lord of
parliament appealed, that is, accused of a crime, by a private person, not
for the satisfaction of public justice, but of his own private wrong, shall not
be tried by his peers, but by a jury of commoners. When this law was
introduced, the lords were few in number, immensely rich and powerful,
linked together frequently by alliances, almost always by factions. In this
towering situation, they looked down on the lower ranks with disdain; frequently
injured and oppressed them; and little prospect would the poor
commoner have of redress, were the criminal to be tried by those of his
own rank, several of them his relations, most of them liable to be suspected
of the same offences; especially, as the law will not allow a lord to be
challenged. Neither did the lord run any extraordinary risk of being unjustly
condemned. The lower rank of people in all countries and ages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
have been used to look with respect on persons possessed of great wealth
and power, invested with titles of honour, and dignified by blood of an antient
descent. But, in those military ages, such veneration was highly encreased
by that valour and personal bravery, which distinguished every one
of the nobility, and than which no virtue is more apt to captivate, in general,
the hearts of mankind. Besides, that the lord had his advantage of
challenging suspected jurors; whereas, if tried by his peers, he had not such
privilege of exception, though they were ever so notoriously his enemies.
Every commoner almost, how great soever, was, in those days, under the
influence of some one or other of the lords, and there could be little
doubt but that influence would be exerted, and successfully too, unless the
guilt was too clear and evident.</p>

<p>It may here be asked, When a civil suit is depending between a lord
and a commoner, how the issue is to be tried, whether by the lords alone,
or by commoners only, or by a jury composed of an equal number of each;
in the same manner, as, when an alien is tried, it is by a jury half natives,
half aliens? The answer is, it shall be tried by a jury of commoners; only,
on account of the dignity of the lord, there must be a knight on the jury.
I need not enlarge on the reason, as it is the same with the former, the
lesser danger of partiality.</p>

<p>I now come to the other part of the disjunctive, <i>aut per legem terræ</i>;
and it will be necessary to point out in general (for to descend into particulars,
would carry me a great deal too far) the principal cases, where this <i>lex
terræ</i> supersedes the trial <i>per pares</i>. First, then, if a man accused of a crime
pleads guilty, so that there is no doubt of the fact, it would be an absurd
and useless delay to summon a jury, to find what is already admitted: accordingly,
by the <i>lex terræ</i> judgment is given on the confession. So in a
civil action, if the defendant confesses the action, or if he appears, and afterwards,
when he should defend himself, makes default, and will not
plead (which case is equivalent to confession) no jury is requisite. So, if
both parties plead all the matters material in the case, and a demurrer is
joined, that is, the facts agreed on both sides, and only the matter of right,
depending on the facts already allowed, in contest, the judges shall try by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
demurrer, and give judgment according to <i>law</i> without a jury. The general
rule is, that a jury shall try <i>facts</i>, and the judges the <i>law</i>; for it would
carry a face of absurdity to expect from a common, or indeed, from any
jury, a decision of a point of law that is controverted between the lawyers
of the plaintiff and defendant, who have made that science their particular
study. Besides, as the law inflicts so heavy a punishment on jurors who
give a false verdict, it would be the utmost cruelty to force men unpractised
in law to run such a hazard, where it must be supposed an equal chance,
at least, they may mistake. The same dangers that the jurors would run
by mistaking the law, hath, in points complicated both of law and fact,
introduced <i>special verdicts</i>, that is, the finding of all the facts by the jury,
and the leaving the matter of right to be judged by the court, who best
know the law: but this by way of digression.</p>

<p>All the proceedings of courts to bring causes to a hearing previous to
the impannelling a jury, and the carrying judgments into execution, are
<i>per legem terræ</i>, or, as my Lord Coke expresses it, the due process of the
law is <i>lex terræ</i>. The inflicting of punishment by the discretion of courts
for all contempts of their authority, without the intervention of a jury, is
also, I think part of the <i>lex terræ</i>, and founded in the necessity of enforcing
due respect and obedience to courts of justice, and supporting their due
dignity. The outlawing a person who absconds, and cannot be found,
so as to oblige him to answer a charge against him, whether civil or criminal,
is one of these proceedings <i>per legem terræ</i> without a jury; of which, as I
have now occasion, it will not be amiss to give a short account, as it is in
daily practice<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>.</p>

<p>By the very antient law of England, the consequence of outlawry was
very troublesome. Not only a seizure of the person, lands and goods, was
lawful, but he was looked upon, not, merely, as one out of the protection
of the law, but also as a publick enemy; for whoever met him had a right
to slay him. This barbarous law undoubtedly proceeded hence, that no
person was then ever outlawed but for a felony; that is, a crime whose punishment
was death; but it was a most absurd thing to allow every private
person to execute the offender, who by refusing to answer has confessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
himself guilty: and the absurdity became more glaring, when, about Henry
the Third’s time, process of outlawry began to be extended to all trespasses
committed <i>vi et armis</i>, when the consequences were so dreadful. Such
extension seems surprising; yet the turbulent condition of the times will, in
some measure, account for it; when, under pretence of dormant titles, forcible
possessions, not without frequent bloodshed and murders, were daily
taken by the adherents of the king or barons, as their respective parties
prevailed. But when the times grew peaceable, this bloody maxim wore
out, and in the beginning of Edward the Third’s reign, it was resolved by
all the judges, that the putting any man to death, except by the sheriff,
and even by him without due warrant in law, however outlawed and convicted,
was murder; and since the forementioned times, as the number of
people encreased, and the opportunities of concealment and absconding
along with them, it has been found necessary to grant the process of
outlawry in many civil actions.</p>

<p>I shall briefly point out the proceedings therein, to shew the abundant
care the law of England takes, on the one hand, to do justice to the plaintiff,
if the defendant absconds, and will not appear; and, on the other,
that the defendant may have all possible opportunity of notice before the
outlawry be pronounced against him. First, there issue three writs successively,
to take the body of the defendant, if found in his bailywick or
county, and to bring him to answer. The first is called a <i>capias</i>, from that
mandatory word in the writ. When the sheriff cannot find him in his
bailywick, he returns a <i>non est inventus</i> on the back of the writ, on which
there issues a second <i>capias</i>, called an <i>alias</i>, from its reciting that <i>alias</i>, or
before this, the like writ had issued. On the same return of <i>non est inventus</i>
to this (for if upon any of the processes the defendant is taken, or comes
voluntarily in, so as to answer, the end is obtained, and no further proceedings
to outlawry go on), the third writ issues called a <i>pluries</i>, because it recites
the sheriff had been <i>pluries</i>, that is, twice before, commanded to take
him. The sending these three writs, one after the other, in order to bring
in the party is, I presume (as, undoubtedly many of the antient practices
in our courts of law are) borrowed from the civil law; for by that law
they issued three citations, at the distance of ten days, one after another, to
call in the party to answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span></p>

<p>But as, upon a return of a <i>non est inventus</i> on the third <i>capias</i>, the personal
apprehending the defendant may well be despaired of, the law proceeds
another way; in order, if possible, to give him notice, that is by issuing
the writ of <i>exigent</i>, so called from the Latin word <i>exigere</i>, to <i>require</i>,
or <i>call upon</i>. This writ commands the sheriff to call the defendant in his
county-court, where all the persons of the county are supposed to have
business, or at least some that can inform him might have. The words
are, <i>We command you that you cause such a one to be required from county-court
to county-court, until, according to the law and custom of our realm, he be outlawed
if he doth not appear. And if he do appear, him to take, and safely keep,
and so forth.</i> Now the law and custom of the realm requires, in this case,
that the party should be called on five different county-court days, one
after another, before he can be outlawed; and these courts being held at
the distance of four weeks from each other, the interval amounts to sixteen
weeks, besides the time of the three previous <i>capias’s</i>; a time so abundantly
sufficient, as it is scarce to be presumed possible a person living in the county
should not have notice; and consequently, on his not appearing in the
fifth court, the coroners of the county, whose duty it is, give judgment of
outlawry against him.</p>

<p>Such is the care the common law takes to prevent outlawries by surprize.
But the act of the thirty-first of Elizabeth in England, enacted here in the
eleventh of James, had superadded another caution, namely three publick
proclamations. The reason of this superadded caution was, I presume, on
account of the dwindling of the business in the county-courts, and, in consequence,
their being not so well attended. This writ, commanding the
sheriff to make proclamation, issues with the <i>exigent</i>, and recites it, and
the cause for which the proceeding to an outlawry is, and directs him to
proclaim the party three several days; first in the county-court, secondly at
the quarter-sessions, a court of more resort, and lastly on a Sunday immediately
after Divine service, at the most usual door of the church of the parish,
where the person dwelt at the time the <i>exigent</i> issued; or if no church,
in the church-yard of the parish; or if no parish, at the nearest church,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
and all outlawries in personal actions, where these solemnities are not observed,
are declared void.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular on this head, to shew the abundant care
the law has taken in these proceedings, and to vindicate it from the common
complaint, of outlawries being obtained surreptitiously, and without
notice. I am sensible such complaints are generally without foundation;
but if in any case they are just, the fault is not in the law, but in man,
in the laws not being duly executed; and if we are to complain of the
best laws, until they be in all cases perfectly and uprightly executed, we
shall never cease complaining while human nature is what it is, weak and
corrupt<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Continuation of the commentary on Magna Charta.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having mentioned the several kinds of proceeding to judgment
without the intervention of juries, practised by the courts of common
law, and authorised under the words of this statute, <i>per legem terræ</i>,
it will be proper, before I quit this head, to say something of other kinds
of courts which do not admit this method of trial; which, yet, have been
received, and allowed authority in England; and whose proceedings, however
different from those of the common law, are justified by the same
words, <i>per legem terræ</i>. These are the courts <i>ecclesiastical</i>, <i>maritime</i>, and
<i>military</i>.</p>

<p>If we trace back the origin of ecclesiastical jurisdictions, we shall find
its source in that advice of St. Paul, who reproves the new christians for scandalising
their profession, by carrying on law-suits against each other before
heathen judges, and recommends their leaving all matters in dispute between
them to the decision of the <i>Ecclesiæ</i>, or the congregation of the
faithful. In the fervour of the zeal of these times, this counsel was soon
followed as a law. The heathen tribunals scarce ever heard of any of their
controversies. They were all carried before the bishop, who, with his
clergy, presided in the congregation; and who, from the deference the laity
paid them, became at length the sole judges, as, in after ages, the bishop
became sole judge, to the exclusion of his clergy. These judges, however,
being, properly speaking, only <i>arbitrators</i>, had no coercive power to enforce
their judgments. They were obliged, therefore, to make use of that
only means they had of bringing the refractory to submission, namely, excluding
them from the rights of the church, and warning other Christians
against their company, and indeed, it was an effectual one; for what could
a Christian, despised and abhorred by the heathen, and shut out from the
commerce of his brethren, do, but submit? Besides, if he was really a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
Christian, this proceeding seems founded on the words of the Apostle, “He
that will not hear the <i>ecclesia</i>, the congregation, let him be unto thee as
an heathen<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.”</p>

<p>Thus was <i>excommunication</i> the only process in the primitive church to
inforce obedience, as it is in ecclesiastical courts at this day; though, considering
the many petty and trifling occasions on which they are, of necessity,
obliged to have recourse to these arms, having no other, and the many
temporal inconveniencies it may be attended with, it has been the opinion
of many wise and learned, as well as of many pious men, that it would
not be unworthy the attention of the legislature to devise some other
coercive means for the punishment of contempts, and to restrain excommunication
to extraordinary offences only. Though, if we consider that the
jealousy which the temporal courts, and the laity in general, so justly conceived
of these judicatures in the time of popery, hath not even yet entirely
subsided, there is little prospect that this or any other regulation, to amend
their proceedings, and others they do want, will be attempted.</p>

<p>When the empire became Christian, these courts and their authority were
fully established in the minds of the people. However, that the temporal
courts might not be stripped of their jurisdiction, and churchmen become
the sole judges, a distinction was made between matters of spiritual and
temporal cognizance; not but several matters, originally and naturally temporal,
were allowed, by the grants of the emperors, to the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction; and even, of such as were not allowed them, they might take
cognizance, if both the parties agreed thereto. This was called <i>proroguing</i>
the jurisdiction, that is, extending, by the consent of the litigants, its
power to matters that do not properly belong to it. A practice our law
has most justly rejected; for it would introduce confusion, and a perpetual
clashing of courts, if it was in the power of the private persons to break
down the fences that the constitution has so wisely erected ta keep every
judicature within its strict bounds. And indeed this practice was one of
the great engines the churchmen made use of, in their grand scheme of
swallowing up all temporal jurisdiction and power. The method of trial in
these courts was by the depositions of witnesses; and upon them the judge
determined both the law and the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<p>Trials by jury were entirely unknown to the Romans, though indeed
their <i>centumviral court</i>, in the early times, bore some resemblance to them;
and even when the northern nations, who were the introducers of the trial
<i>per pares</i>, became Christians, the ecclesiastical courts on the continent proceeded
in their old manner. But in England, during the times of the
Saxons, both spiritual and temporal courts, though their business was distinct,
sat together, and mutually assisted each other, as I observed under
the Conqueror’s reign. But whether the matter of fact in ecclesiastical
causes was then tried by a jury, I will not pretend to affirm, though, from
the peculiar fondness the Saxons had, above the other northern nations, for
that method of trial, it may seem not improbable. However, this is certain,
that from the time William, who, to gratify the court of Rome, and
to shew his own political purposes, separated the courts, the proceedings of
the spiritual ones in England have been conformed to the practice of those
courts abroad, and to the canon law. The alteration, if indeed there was
any, was sufficiently authorised by the king and pope; and indeed as all
the bishoprics were filled by Normans, they knew not how to proceed in
any other manner. By the time of John, the proceedings of these courts,
and their trial of causes without jury, had been universally fixed, and
received as a part of the <i>lex terræ</i>, and, as such, is confirmed by the words
of this statute.</p>

<p>The next court that the law of the land allows to proceed to sentence
without a jury is the Court of <i>Admiralty</i>, and that for absolute necessity;
for as its jurisdiction is not allowed as to any thing that happens within the
body of a county, except in one particular instance, <i>contracts for sailors
wages</i>, but extends only to things done on the sea, or at most to contracts
made in foreign countries (though this last is denied by the lawyers of our
days to belong to them) there is no place from whence a jury can come.
For the jury of the county, where the cause of suit arose, are the triers,
but here, it arose in none. Besides, the great excellency of this method of
trial consists in this, that the jury, from their vicinity, have opportunities of
knowing something of the nature of the case, and of being acquainted with
the characters and credit of the witnesses, neither of which can be supposed
in this case. In this court the judge determines both matter of law and
fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span></p>

<p>The same was the case of the Constable’s and Marshal’s Court, formerly
of great power, but now next to antiquated. Its jurisdiction was, first,
<i>martial law</i>, over the soldiers and attendants of the camp. Now the trial
of offenders in this kind, by a jury, whether taken out of the army, or out
of the county, if in the kingdom, would have effectually destroyed that
strict subordination, which is the soul of military enterprises. Secondly,
they had the trials of treasons and felonies done by the king’s subjects in
foreign kingdoms. Here there could be no trial by jury, for the same
reason as given already for the Court of Admiralty. The last part of their
jurisdiction was as to precedence, arms, and marks of dignity, which flowing
immediately from the grace of the crown, the sole disposer and judge
of them, were not supposed to be in the cognizance of jurors, but proper
to be determined by the king’s judges, who had the keeping of the memorials
of his grants in this kind. Besides, these honorary distinctions are
not local, but universal through the realm; so that there is no particular
county from whence a jury should come<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>.</p>

<p>Such are the reasons assigned why these two courts proceed <i>per legem
terræ</i>, and not by juries; but, to speak my own opinion truly, when I
consider that their methods are formed upon the proceedings of the civil
law, I suspect a farther design. The discovery and revival of this law happened
in the reign of our Stephen. I have already had occasion to observe
how greatly the princes, in every part of Europe, were flattered by the
tempting bait of unlimited power it set before them, and particularly the
kings of England, who were the first that set out in pursuit of this delusive
object; and that their being less successful than others was, very probably,
owing to their beginning the career too early. When I consider then that
these two courts, where trials by juries prevail not, dealt in matters that
were of the resort of the prerogative, and that, in consequence, the modelling
of them was left to the king; when I see all the parts of these models
taken from the imperial law; when I reflect on the notoriously avowed and
unjust preference the weakest of them gave to that against the common
law, and the kind patronage the wisest and most moderate of them shewed
to it, and its possessions, down to the reign of Charles the Second, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
help suspecting a deeper design. And, indeed, the common lawyers
seemed to take the alarm, and decried and despised every part of this law,
though most of it is founded on good reason, merely out of the apprehensions,
that giving it the least countenance, might, in time, open a door for
the absolute authority of the prince, and the rapaciousness of his <i>fisc</i> or treasury,
and thereby overturn the constitution.</p>

<p>But there are other courts, besides those already named, that proceed
upon the deposition of witnesses, and not by jury, I mean the courts of
Equity; which, in imitation of the civil and canon laws, oblige a party to
answer upon oath to his adversary’s charge. This practice, though not
allowed by common law, is founded in very good reason. For, as the
proper business of a court of equity is to detect fraud and surprize, these
things being done in private, and endeavoured to be as much concealed as
possible, it is but reasonable that the plaintiff should have power to sift the
conscience of his adversary, and to examine not to a single point, as the
<i>issues</i> at common law are, but to many separate facts, from which, taken
together, the fraud, if any, may appear. Such matters, therefore, being
of nice discussion, and of a complicated nature, are not fit for the decision of
a jury, and indeed would take up more time than they could possibly employ
in the examination. The court, therefore, go upon <i>depositions</i>, and judge
both of the law and fact. However, if a matter of fact, necessary for the
decision of the cause, appears on the deposition doubtful; or if any matter
arise which these courts have no power to try, they direct an issue, wherein
the point is tried by jury, in a court of common law; and thus, these
courts have the advantage of both methods of trial, as well that of the civil,
as that used by the common law; namely the oath of the party, and depositions
from one, and the trial by jury from the other.</p>

<p>This method, however, of trial by deposition, has been objected to, as
productive of enormous expence and delays; and it cannot be denied, that,
as affairs are now conducted, there is too much reason for the objection. Yet
to this it may be answered, that if examiners were more careful, and would
set down nothing but what is evidence, and were the rules of court, to cut off
delays, always strictly inforced, the damage arising from both these heads
would be considerably lessened. To cut off all delays, and to reduce the
proceedings to as summary a method as that of the courts of common law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
would, (considering the matters they are conversant about are of different
proof, and require the most acute examination) instead of preventing frauds
in most instances, by a hurried manner of trial, serve to defend and encourage
them. The policy of the common law was to reduce the matter in
question to a single fact, which the jury might, with ease and convenience,
determine within a convenient time. And it must be owned that the lawyers
and judges of latter days, by admitting the trial of titles to lands in personal
actions, have deviated much from the simplicity of the law, and weakened
the excellence of the trial by jury. The present practice, of determining the
title to land by an action of trespass, will serve as an instance; where the
enquiry is, whether a man’s entering upon lands was a trespass or not; if he
had right to enter in, it was no trespass; if he had not, it was otherwise.
Now, as the right may depend upon twenty different matters of fact, beside
matters of law, all which must be settled and weighed, before the bare
question of trespass can be determined, it is easy to see to what lengths trial
by juries may be now spun; to how short a time the examination of the most
material points must be confined; how imperfect, consequently, the examination
must often be; to say nothing of the danger of a jury’s erring
when both body and mind is wearied out with long attendance, and the
attention consequently enfeebled.</p>

<p>If it be asked, how came this deviation, which has been attended with
so many inconveniencies? The true answer is the best, that it sprung from
the advantage of practitioners, and the litigiousness of suitors. By the
common law, no man could bring two actions of the same nature for the
same thing. If I am entitled to the possession of lands, I may bring my <i>writ
of entry</i>, or an <i>assize</i>, to recover it; but if I am foiled, I cannot bring a
second. So, if I am entitled to the propriety of the land, I may bring my
writ of right, and if I recover not therein, my right is gone for ever.
The litigiousness of suitors, who had a mind to gain a method of trying
the same thing over and over again, where they miscarried, introduced
this method I am speaking of. For every new entry was a new trespass, and
could not be said to have been tried before; though whether it was a trespass
or not, depends on what had been tried before, and the avarice of practitioners,
who desired frequent suits, encouraged it. But when once it was
allowed, notwithstanding all the complaints of Coke and his co-temporary
judges, it became universally followed, and is now so established, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
higher actions so much out of use, that I question whether there is a lawyer
living who would be able, without a great deal of study, to conduct a cause
in one of those antiquated real actions. The inconveniencies of these frequent
trials introduced, for the obviating them, a new practice, the applying
to the court of chancery, after two or more verdicts consonant to one
another, for an injunction to stop farther proceedings at law; which,
though a new, was become a necessary curb, after the common law-courts
had allowed the former method.</p>

<p>Besides these courts already mentioned, there are many other judicatories,
which, by particular acts of parliament, have particular matters entrusted
to their determination, without the intervention of juries; as the
several matters determinable summarily by one or more justices of the peace;
the affairs of the revenue by the commissioners; and suits by civil bills for
limited sums by judges of assize; though in these last the presiding judge
may, and ought, in matters of difficulty, to call a jury to his assistance;
and it must be owned in this poor country the alteration of the law in this
last particular, has been attended with very good consequences. The expediency
of the two former changes, indeed, has been much disputed; but
that being a question of <i>politicks</i>, not of law, I shall not enter into it.</p>

<p>Thus much I have observed, in a summary way, concerning the several
methods of trial, differing from that <i>per pares</i>, which are authorised by
these words of <i>Magna Charta, per legem terræ</i>.</p>

<p>I shall next proceed to the point of the <i>personal liberty of the subject</i>; but
as it will be proper to take all that together, in one view, I shall here conclude
the present Lecture.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Continuation of the commentary on Magna Charta.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having explained the import of the words <i>per legale judicium parium
suorum, vel per legem terræ</i>, which refer to, and qualify all the preceeding
parts, it will be proper to mention those preceeding articles, and to
make some observations upon them. They then consist of six different
heads. The first relates to the personal liberty of the subject; the second
to the preservation of his landed property; the third is intended to defend
him from unjust outlawry; the fourth to prevent unjust banishment; the
fifth prohibits all manner of destruction; and the design of the sixth is to
regulate criminal prosecutions at the suit of the king. I shall briefly treat of
all these particulars in the order in which they stand.</p>

<p>The first clause tending to secure personal liberty, runs in these words;
<i>Nullus liber homo capiatur vel imprisonetur</i>. <i>Liber homo</i>, as I before observed,
here extends to all the subjects, and is not to be taken in its more restrained
sense, of a freeholder. We see the words are not barely against wrongful
imprisonment, but extend to arresting, or taking, <i>nullus capiatur</i>. This
act extends not only to prevent private persons, particularly the great men,
from arresting and imprisoning the subjects, but extends also to those from
whom, on account of their extraordinary power, the greatest danger might
be apprehended, I mean the king’s ministerial officers, his council, nay
himself, acting in person. “No man,” (says my Lord Coke, commenting
on this point,) “shall be taken, that is restrained of liberty, by petition or
suggestion to the king, or his council; unless it be by indictment, or presentment
of good and lawful men, where such deeds be done.” For in
that case it is <i>per legale judicium parium</i>; though an indictment found, or
a presentment made by a grand jury, in one sense, cannot properly be called
<i>judicium</i>, as it is not conclusive; but the fact must be after tried by a petty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
jury; yet for the purpose of restraining and securing a person accused upon
record, that he may be forthcoming on his trial, it is <i>judicium parium</i>.
Otherwise the most flagrant offenders might escape being tried and convicted<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth chapter of Westminster the first, enacted in the third
year of Edward the First, and ordained to ascertain for what offences a man
might be detained in prison, and to make effectual provision for the bailing
out persons upon their giving security to abide a trial, those accused of the
slighter offences, persons detained <i>per maundement de roy</i> by the command of
the king, are mentioned as not bailable; and this may seem to contradict
the law I have now laid down. Yet, when rightly understood, it doth
not. For as judge Gascoigne rightly said, the king hath committed all his
power judicial to divers courts, some to one, some to another; and it is a
rule in the construction of statutes, that when any judicial act is referred
to the king, it is to be understood to be done in some court of justice, according
to law. The command of the king, therefore, doth not mean the
king’s private will, but a legal command, issued in his name, by his judges,
to whom his judicial power is intrusted. Accordingly, Sir John Markham,
chief justice, told Edward the Fourth, that the king could not arrest any
man for suspicion of treason, or felony, as any of his subjects might; and
he gave a most excellent reason for it: Because, says he, if the king did
wrong, the party could not have his action. In the sixteenth of Henry the
Sixth, it was resolved by the whole court, That if the king command me to
arrest a man, and I do arrest him, he shall have his action of false imprisonment
against me, although I did it in the king’s presence.</p>

<p>The maxim, then, is, that no man shall be taken and committed to prison,
but by <i>judicium parium, vel per legem terræ</i>, that is, by due process of
law. Now to understand this, it is necessary to see in what cases a man
may be taken before presentment or indictment by a jury; and in the enquiry
it is to be considered, that process of law, for this purpose, is two-fold,
either by the king’s writ, to bring him into a court of justice, to <i>answer</i>,
or by what is called <i>a warrant in law</i>. And this is, again, two-fold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
<i>indeed</i>, by the authority of a legal magistrate, as a Justice of Peace’s <i>mittimus</i>,
or that which each private person is invested with, and may exercise.</p>

<p>First then, for making a <i>mittimus</i> a good warrant, it is previously necessary,
that there should be an information on oath, before a magistrate having
lawful authority, that the party hath committed an offence; or at least
of some positive fact, that carries with it a strong and violent presumption
that he hath so done: Next, then, the <i>mittimus</i> must contain the offence in
certain, that it may appear whether the offence charged is such an one as
justifies the taking; whether it is bailable, or such as the law requires the detention
in prison. A warrant without the cause expressed, is a void one, and
imprisonment on it illegal, and so it was adjudged in Charles the First’s
reign, though done by the secretaries of state, by the king’s authority, with
the advice of his council; thirdly, the warrant must not only contain a lawful
cause, but have a legal conclusion, <i>and him safely to keep until delivered by
law</i>; not until the party committing doth farther order, for that would be
to make the magistrate, who is only <i>ministerial</i>, <i>judicial</i>, as to the point of the
liberty of the subject; from whence might redound great mischief to the
party on one hand, or to the king and public on the other, by letting an
offender escape.</p>

<p>Let us see how far the law warrants a private person to take another,
and commit him to prison. First, then, if a man is present when another
commits treason, felony, or notorious breach of the peace, he hath a right
instantly to arrest and commit him, lest he should escape if any affray be
made, to the breach of the peace, any man present may, during the continuance
of the affray, by a warrant in law, in order to prevent imminent
mischief, restrain any of the offenders; but if the affray is over, so that the
danger is perfectly past, there is a necessity of an information, and an express
warrant; so, if one man wounds another dangerously, any person may
arrest him, that he be safely kept, until it be known whether the party
wounded shall die or not. Suspicion, also, where it is violent and strong,
is, in many cases, a good cause of imprisonment. Suppose a felony done,
and the hue and cry of the country is raised, to pursue and take the offender,
any man may arrest another whom he finds flying; for what greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
presumption of guilt can there be, than for a person, instead of joining the
hue and cry as his duty prompts him, to fly from it? His good character
or his innocence, how clear it may after appear, shall not avail him. His
imprisonment is lawful.</p>

<p>Another lawful cause of arresting and imprisoning upon suspicion is, if
a treason or felony is certainly done; and though there is no certain evidence
against any person as the perpetrator, yet if the public voice and fame
is, that A is guilty, it is lawful for any man to arrest and detain him. So,
if a treason or felony be done, and though there be no public fame, any
one that suspects another for the author of the fact may arrest him. But
let him that so doth, take care his cause of suspicion will be such as will bear
the test; for otherwise he may be punishable for false imprisonment. The
frequent keeping company with a notorious thief, that is, one that had been
convicted, or outlawed, or proclaimed as such, was a good cause of imprisonment.
Lastly, a watchman may arrest a night-walker at unseasonable
hours by the common law, however peaceably he might demean himself;
for strolling at unusual hours was a just cause of suspicion of an ill intent.
With respect to persons arrested by private authority, I must observe, that
the law of England so abhors imprisonment, without a certain cause shewn,
that if there is not an information on oath sworn before a magistrate, and
his commitment thereon in a competent time, which is esteemed twenty-four
hours, the person is no longer to be detained<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>.</p>

<p>Such is the law of England with respect to the personal liberty of the
subject. Let us now see the remedies the law provides for those that suffer
by its being infringed: the writ of <i>odio &amp; atia</i> I have already mentioned,
and that it is long since out of use: the most usual way then to remedy this,
and to deliver the party, is the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, in obedience to which,
the person imprisoned is brought into court by the sheriff, who is the keeper
of the prison, together with the cause of his caption and detention, that the
court may judge whether the first taking was lawful; and if it was, whether
the continuance of the imprisonment is such; and this is brought in the
name of the party himself imprisoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span></p>

<p>The next is the writ <i>de homine replegiando</i>, of replevying a man, that is,
delivering him out upon security, to answer what may be objected against
him. This is most commonly used when a person is not in the legal prison,
but perhaps carried off by private violence, and secreted from his friends,
and therefore may be brought by a near friend having interest in the person’s
liberty, as by a father, or mother, for their child, or a husband for his
wife. These are the remedies for restoring a person unjustly deprived of
liberty, to the enjoyment of that invaluable blessing. But very deficient
would these remedies be, if there were no provisions made for the punishment
of a person offending against his natural right, nor any relief for the
person unjustly aggrieved.</p>

<p>For the point of punishment, an indictment will lie at the king’s suit,
against the false imprisoner, grounded on this statute, for the vindication of
the public justice of the nation; and the party, if found guilty, shall be
punished by fine and imprisonment. For the relief of the person injured,
he may have an action of false imprisonment, wherein he shall recover damages;
or an action on the case grounded on this statute, wherein he shall
have the same remedy. For Coke observes on this statute, that it is a general
rule, where an act of parliament is made against any public mischief or
grievance, there is either given expressly, or else implied by the law, an
action to the party injured.</p>

<p>Such is the antient original law of England with respect to liberty; and
so different from that of other nations of Europe, at least, as their laws are
understood and practised at present, where a man may be imprisoned without
knowing his crime or accuser, or having any means, except of humble
petition, to be brought to his trial. It is therefore no wonder that the people
on the continent envy much the situation of the subjects of these islands,
when they contemplate their own.</p>

<p>The next branch of the statute is, <i>Nullus liber homo disseizetur de libero
tenemento suo, vel libertatibus, vel liberis consuetudinibus suis</i>. Here it may be
thought the word <i>liber homo</i> should be restrained to freeholders, because
none others can be disseized; but the following words, <i>libertatibus</i> and <i>consuetudinibus</i>,
lead, by their import, to a more enlarged construction, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
take in all the subjects; so that <i>disseizetur</i> must not be taken in its limited
peculiar sense, but rather in general for <i>deprivetur</i>. First, then, no freeholder
shall be disseized of his freehold, but by verdict of a jury, or by the
law of the land, as upon default, not pleading, or being outlawed. It was
made to prevent wrongful entries, by such as had right or pretended right
to the land, in order to avoid breaches of the peace and bloodshed, which
often ensued thereon; but it was not intended to take away the entry of a
person who had a right to enter given him by law, for that the law could
never construe a <i>disseizen</i>, which is a wrongful diverting of the freehold.</p>

<p>To understand this, it is necessary to observe, that a man may have right
to the lands, and yet no right to enter upon them; or he may have both;
and in the last case it is no disseizen. If A disseizes B, he shall never, by
his own wrongful act, deprive B of the right of possession; but he may of
his own authority enter at any time, during A’s life, provided he doth it
without breach of the peace. But if A is dead, now the lands being thrown
by the law upon A’s heir, who had no hand in the wrong, and who is answerable
to the Lord Paramount for the services due from the land, B has,
by his own negligence, in not entring, or if he could not enter, claiming,
during A’s life, lost the right of possession; it is transferred to A’s heir,
and B must recover his right by a suit at law.</p>

<p>To see what is meant by <i>libertatibus</i>. It comprehendeth, in the first place,
the laws of the realm, that every man should freely enjoy such advantages
and privileges as these laws give him. Secondly, it signifies the privileges
that some of the subjects, whether single persons, or bodies corporate, have
above others, by the lawful grant of the king; as the chattels of felons or
outlaws, and the lands and privileges of corporations. Hence any grant
of the king, by letters patent to any person, which deprives another subject
of his natural right and free liberties, is against this branch of <i>Magna
Charta</i>, as are all monopolies, which were so plentifully and so oppressively
granted in the reigns of Elizabeth and James the First, and here in Ireland,
in that of Charles the First. We must, however, except such monopolies
as are erected by act of parliament, or by the king’s patents, pursuing the
directions of an act made for that purpose<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, <i>Consuetudinibus</i> takes in and preserves those local customs in
many parts of England, which, though they derogate from the common law,
are yet countenanced and acknowledged as part of the general system of
law. It also extends to any privileges which a subject claims by prescription,
as wreck, waif, stray, and the like<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>.</p>

<p>The next clause is, <i>aut utlagetur</i>; of which having spoken already, I
shall pass on to the fourth, <i>aut exuletur</i>. No man shall be banished out of
the realm, <i>nisi per legem terræ</i>; for the <i>judicium parium</i> is out of this clause,
there being no crime of which a man is convicted, whose sentence is banishment.
The <i>transportation</i> now commonly used for slighter felonies is not
like it; for that is by the free consent of the criminal, who desires to commute
a heavier punishment for a slighter. Now <i>per legem terræ</i> a man may
be exiled two ways, either by act of parliament, as some wicked minions of
our former kings were, and particularly Richard the Second’s corrupt judges
into Ireland; or by a man’s abjuring the realm when accused of felony,
that is, swearing to depart out of the kingdom, never to return; which
latter is long since fallen into disuse. Coke says, that the king cannot send
any subject against his will to serve him out of the realm, and the reason is
strong; for if he could under pretence of service, he might tear him from
his family and country, and transport him to the remotest corner of the
earth, there to remain during the whole of his life<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>. But what shall we
say as to the military tenants, who by the very tenure of their grants were
obliged to serve the king in his wars out of the realm? Certainly, whilst
the feudal system retained its pristine vigour, and personal service was required,
they were an exception to this rule; but when the commutation of
<i>escuage</i> was established, they were considered as under it. Indeed their general
readiness to attend their king’s service in person, gave no occasion for
this question’s ever being decided. The famous case on this point was in
Edward the Third’s reign; that prince had made many grants to Sir Richard
Pembrige, some for <i>servitio impenso</i>, others for <i>servitio impendendo</i>. The
king commanded him to serve in Ireland, as his Lord-deputy, which he positively
refused to do, looking upon the appointment as no better than an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
exile; and for this refusal the king seized all that had been granted to him
<i>pro servitio impendendo</i>; and the question came on in court, whether the
seizure was lawful. The judges clearly held the refusal lawful, and therefore
would not commit him to prison; but as to the seizure, in consequence
of the words <i>pro servitio impendendo</i>, without specifying where, they thought
it justified. But Coke says, “it seemeth to me that the seizure was unlawful.”
For <i>pro servitio impenso</i>, and <i>impendendo</i>, must be intended of lawful
service within the realm. The last time this act was violated was in the
reign of the misguided James the First, in the case of the unfortunate Sir
Thomas Overbury; who for refusing to go ambassador to Muscovy, was
by that prince sent to the Tower, in which place he was afterwards barbarously
poisoned; and for his murder the favourite Somerset and his countess
were both condemned to die<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Continuation of the commentary on Magna Charta.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The fifth branch of this statute is in very general terms; it is, <i>aut
aliquo modo destruatur</i>. “<i>Destruction</i>” is a word of very general import.
Coke, in the first place, explains it by saying, “no man shall be fore-judged
of life or limb, or put to the torture or death, without legal
trial.” But he shews, afterwards, by his instances, that it is much more
extensive: For he observes, that “when <i>any thing</i> is prohibited, <i>every thing</i>
is prohibited which necessarily leads to it.” Every thing, therefore,
openly and visibly tending to a man’s destruction, either as to life, limb, or
the capacity of sustaining life, is hereby directly forbid: So that, <i>torture</i>,
as it endangers life and limbs, and may prevent a man from earning his
livelihood, is, on all these three accounts, unlawful, though common among
all other nations of Europe, who have borrowed it from the old Roman law
with respect to slaves; a plain indication in what light the introducers of it
looked on their subjects. It cannot be said that this hath never been violated
in England in arbitrary times; (as what nation is there, whose fundamental
laws have not been, on occasion, violated?) yet, in five hundred
years, I do not believe the English history can afford ten instances<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>.</p>

<p>For the same reason, “judging a man, either in a civil or criminal cause,
without calling him to answer and make his defence,” is against this provision.
So likewise is “the not producing the witnesses, that the party
may have an opportunity to cross-examine them,” I believe, if they may
be had. For in the case of death, or absence in a foreign country, that
they cannot be produced, there is an exception, for very necessity’s sake;
and in that case, the examination of such person, taken before a proper magistrate,
is good evidence, tho’ thereby the party loses the cross-examination
or information against the murderer. But whenever this happens, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
jury should consider that the party has lost the benefit of the cross-examination,
and have that in their contemplation, when they are preparing to
give their verdict. Directly contrary to this fundamental law, and to common
justice, was the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, conduced by Coke, attorney-general,
upon the depositions of people who might be brought face
to face. For, notwithstanding the perfect knowledge of that great lawyer
in the laws of England, he was a most time-serving minister of the crown.
The people of these nations are much indebted to him for his excellent
writings on the law, and more for demonstrating the antient right of the
people of England to the liberties they claimed: But, if we consider that
he was then in disgrace at court, I fear this panegyric must be confined to
his behaviour while a judge, which was without reproach; nor did he hesitate
to forfeit the favour of the crown, by opposing incroachments on the
law of England.</p>

<p>As <i>tending to destruction</i>; it is likewise unlawful to amerce or fine a man
convicted of a crime, beyond what he has a possibility of paying; for that
would tend to perpetual imprisonment, and disabling him from maintaining
himself and family. Neither is it lawful, tho’ a man be indicted of treason
or felony, for the king to grant, or even to promise, the forfeiture of his
lands or goods; for this would be throwing a temptation in the way of
others to suborn witnesses to his destruction. These I mention, only as particular
instances, to open the import of this law; but the words are, <i>aliquo
modo destruatur</i>, taking in “every thing that directly tends to destruction.”
And it must be observed that these words, <i>aliquo modo</i>, are not in any other
branch of this act.</p>

<p>I come now to the last clause of this first part, <i>nec super eum ibimus, nec
super eum mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, aut per legem terræ</i>.
I observed before, from the words here being in the first person, that they
refer to the suit of the king; and they relate not only, by the latter words,
to a legal trial, as to matter and form, but also to a trial in a proper and legal
court. The words <i>nec super eum ibimus</i> belong to the King’s Bench, where
the suits of the king, the <i>placita coronæ</i>, are properly handled, and where
the king is always supposed to be present. The words <i>super cum mittemus</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
refer to other courts sitting for the same purposes, as Justice of gaol-delivery,
for instance, under the king’s commission. But when those words
are coupled with the following ones, <i>per legem terræ</i>, they carry a farther
import; not only that the courts, trying the king’s causes should proceed
according to the law of the land, but that the courts themselves should be
such as the <i>lex terræ</i> authorizes; that is, either the common law, from time
immemorial, or acts of parliament. So that the king hath no power, of his
own authority, to form new criminal courts, as he may civil ones. In some
cases, he appoints, indeed, the judges of the courts of common law, and
issues commissions, and appoints the commissioners in criminal courts authorized
by parliament; but no farther doth his power extend.</p>

<p>To this it may be objected, that the king may create a county palatine,
and consequently new criminal courts; but let this be considered: Counties,
and duchies, such as we call <i>palatine</i>, were, I may say, indeed of the essence
of a feudal kingdom, as ours originally was; that is, the king might dismember
a part of his kingdom from the immediate subjection to the crown,
transfer a subordinate degree of the legal rights to a subject; and when a
county of that kind was created, without saying any more, all the courts,
not new ones, but the same that were at common law through the whole
kingdom, followed as incidents; in the same manner as by erecting a new
county, not palatine, it had its county-court, and the sheriff’s tourne.
These are not erecting, properly speaking, new courts, so much as bringing
the old ones home to the doors of the people of that district.</p>

<p>As I observed at the beginning, this law naturally divides itself into two
parts, the first ending at the words <i>per legem terræ</i>. Having made such observations
as have occurred to me as necessary or material for the understanding
thereof, I now proceed to the latter part of this statute, which
runs in these words: <i>Nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut deferemus justitiam,
vel rectum</i>. Some have imagined that, by these words, in the disjunctive,
are meant common law and equity; but courts of equity, and proceedings
in cases of equity in those courts, were not known in times so early; and
the legal signification of <i>rectum</i> in old statutes, and law-books, is either the
right that a man hath to a thing, or the law of the land, the means of attaining
the possession and enjoyment of that right; and in that sense it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
here to be taken; as Coke says, <i>justice</i> is the end, <i>rectum</i> the means, namely,
due process of law; neither of which is to be sold, denied, or delayed
to the subject. In order to understand this, it will be necessary to point
out some of the mischiefs that were before this act, which is the surest way
to expound the meaning of any law<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>.</p>

<p>For this purpose it is to be remembered, that, in the Saxon times, almost
all suits, except between grandees, were expedited in the county-courts.
I have observed before, that the Conqueror and his successors discouraged
these, and encouraged suits in the <i>Aula Regis</i>, or king’s courts; and that the
subjects were fond of suing there; but still it was a matter of favour, where
the cause properly belonged to the country jurisdictions, and could not be
demanded as a right. As a matter of favour, it might be denied by the
king, or his chancellor, who was the issuer of the original writs, unless a
sum of money was paid, such as they demanded. This was <i>selling</i> justice.
Or, if the person to be sued was a favourite of the king, or chancellor, the
writ might be denied; this was <i>denying</i> justice. Or, if it was granted, as
the proceedings were <i>ex gratia</i>, the party might, <i>ad libitum</i>, be delayed by
the judges, or the cause might be stopped by order of the king, and this
was the <i>deferring</i> of justice, meant by this act, which was intended for the
giving every subject a right, in all cases, and against all persons, to have
justice administered to him in the king’s courts. The chancellor now is
hereby obliged instantly to issue all original writs, and the judges of the several
courts, where causes depend, to issue the proper judicial ones without
fee or reward. This, however, is not so to be understood, as to prohibit
the moderate and accustomed fees, which, from time immemorial, have
been paid to the officer, for his trouble in making them out, or to the
judge, for putting the seal; for these are a part of their livelihood, but only
those arbitrary sums which were before taken, and which the state properly
calls the <i>selling</i> of justice. So likewise the judges are obliged, in
every cause before them, to proceed with expedition, and to suffer no delays,
but such as the law allows, and requires, for giving each party an opportunity
of defence, and of laying his cause fully before the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span></p>

<p>However, notwithstanding this act, the evil was often repeated, and
many suits stopped by the command of the king, and others, as appears by
four several acts of parliament, made to enforce and explain this one, the
substance of which acts, is summoned by Coke in these words: That “by
no means common right, or common law, should be disturbed or delayed;
no, though it be by command, and under the great seal, or privy
seal, order, writ, letters, message, or commandment whatsoever, either from
the king, or any other; and that the justices shall proceed, as if no
such writs, letters, order, message, or other commandment, were come
to them.” However, this is not to be understood so strictly, but that
the king may stop his own civil suit that he hath instituted for his own benefit,
as a <i>capias</i> for a fine, because <i>quisque juri suo renunciare potest</i>; and
this stoppage, in truth, is for the benefit of the subject. It is otherwise in
criminal accusations, unless he can shew good cause to the court to put it
off. For every man accused has a right to be brought to his trial<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>.</p>

<p>Neither are legal protections within the prohibition of this law; these
were granted to stop suits against any man that was personally employed in
the service of the king, and were founded on this presumption, that such
service was for the public benefit, to which all private regards must give
way. But then these protections, must be legal ones, such, and none other,
as are found in the Register, the antientest book of the law, and not ones
newly devised, and for new-fangled causes. These protections, however,
were greatly abused in the sequel; favourites, and their dependants, frequently
obtaining them, to hinder others of their just rights, under pretence
of serving the king; where in truth, there was no such thing. It is therefore
recorded, highly to the honour of Elizabeth, that she first discontinued
the granting them; and her laudable example has been followed by all her
successors. I shall, therefore, not dwell upon them, it being sufficient to
have mentioned that such things there are, or at least <i>were</i> in our law.</p>

<p>I hope the prolixity with which I have treated of <i>this</i> chapter of <i>Magna
Charta</i>, the care I have taken to open the true meaning and force of every
word in it, and the many tacit exceptions each part of it is subject to, will
be excused, when it is considered, that it not only contains great variety of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
matter, but is the most important, and of more general consequence and
concern, than any other law of the land. It is the guardian of the life, the
liberty, the limbs, the livelihood, the possessions, and to the right to justice
of every individual, and therefore it concerns every man to know it, and
fully to understand it.</p>

<p>The thirtieth chapter is in favour of commerce and merchant strangers.
Certain it is, that, in antient times, the kings of Europe, and their military
subjects, looked on merchandize as a dishonourable profession; as did the
Romans also, in the military ages of that republic. By the old laws of
England, no merchants alien were to frequent England, except at the four
great fairs; and then were permitted to stay but forty days at a time, that
is, an hundred and sixty days in the whole year. But now this act has
altered the former law, and is very favourable to persons engaged in commerce,
who before were little better than at sufferance. It commands, that
all merchants, namely, merchant strangers, whose sovereign is in amity
with the king, unless publicly prohibited, that is, says Coke, by Parliament,
which is true, as the law hath since stood, (but before, I conceive the
king himself had the power to prohibit) shall have safe and sure conduct in
seven things. First, to depart out of England without licence, at their
will and pleasure. Secondly, to come into England in the same manner.
Thirdly, to continue in England without limit of time. Fourthly, to go
and travel through any part of England at their pleasure, by land or water.
Fifthly, free liberty to buy and sell. Sixthly, without any manner of evil,
tolls or taxes; but only, Seventhly, by the old and rightful customs, that
is, by such duties as were of old time accustomed to be paid, and are therefore
called <i>Customs</i>. By this law the king is prohibited from laying any new
taxes on the imports or exports of merchant strangers. And as now they
gained a general licence to continue in the realm, from hence arose that
privilege of merchant strangers to take leases for years, of houses for their
dwelling, and warehouses for their goods, which they continued in England;
for, regularly, all acquisitions of aliens, in lands or tenements, belong
to the king<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<p>The second branch of this act is a very equitable one. It concerns
merchant enemies, or rather such merchant strangers as came in friends,
and afterwards became enemies, by a war’s breaking out between the sovereigns
while they are in England. It provides that, on a war’s so breaking
out, the persons and effects of such merchants should be seized, and
safely kept till it should be known how the English merchants had been
treated in the enemy’s country; and that, if they were well treated, these
should be so too. This regulation, however, is not put in use; because, by
the treaties made between the sovereigns of Europe, it is stipulated, that,
on the breaking out of war, the merchants in each others country should
have a certain number of days to withdraw themselves and their effects.
But if a merchant enemy comes into the country, after war declared, he is
to be treated as an enemy; to which, by the old law, now antiquated, there
was a very humane exception, that of persons driven into England by stress
of weather.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LECTURE_XLIII">LECTURE XLIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Continuation of the commentary on Magna Charta.</i></p>

</div>

<p>As I have dwelt on the twenty-ninth chapter of <i>Magna Charta</i> so long,
and treated of it and every part of it so minutely, I shall, in this lecture,
dispatch the remaining part thereof with more expedition. Indeed,
of the thirty-first I would have said no more, than merely to observe, that it
related to the military tenures now abolished, were it not proper to remark,
that it was made to enforce the old feudal law, then the law of England,
with respect to landed estates, and to restrain John’s successors from the
violences he had introduced in favour of the royal prerogative, to the detriment
of the immunities and privileges of the subjects. It has been already
observed in these lectures, that by the feudal law, especially as established
by the Conqueror in England, the king was very amply provided for with
a landed estate, to support his dignity and expences, which was at that time
looked on all over Europe as unalienable, except during the life of the
king in being; and that the rest of the land was to be the property of the
free subjects of the realm, subject to the services imposed, and the other
consequences of his seignory as feudal lord.</p>

<p>One of these consequences was the escheat on the failure of heirs, either
by there being none, or by the blood being corrupted by the commission
of felony, which in law amounted to the same thing; as no son, uncle,
nephew, or cousin, could by law claim as heir by descent to a person
attainted. For the legal blood, the title to the inheritance, failed in him
the last possessor, by his breach of fealty; and every heir lineal or collateral
by the law of England being obliged to claim as heir to the person last
seized, must be excluded, when the legal blood inheritable failed in the
last possessor.</p>

<p>In consequence of these escheats, which often happened in those times,
both by corruption of blood, and failure of heirs inheritable, (for, as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
have observed before, the granting <i>feuda antiqua ut nova</i> was introduced
only by Henry the Second, the father of John, and were not at this time
become universal, as they since have been) John introduced this new maxim,
that when an earldom or barony fell to the crown by escheat, he held it in
the right of his crown, as it was originally derived from thence; and consequently,
that the tenants of the former lord, being now, instead of <i>intermediate</i>,
become <i>immediate</i> tenants of the crown, held of him <i>in capite</i>, as it
was called; that is, that he, by this escheat, obtained privileges over the
tenants of the former lord, which he, the former lord, never had, or could
have, but which he claimed as king, <i>in jure coronæ</i>. These privileges were
many in number; but it will be sufficient to mention only two of them, to
shew into how much worse a state the tenants of these escheated lordships
were thrown, by being considered as tenants <i>in capite</i>.</p>

<p>First, then, the king had from his tenants <i>in capite</i>, who came into possession
of their lands at full age, instead of <i>relief</i>, to which subject lords
were intitled, and which was only one fourth of the value of the lands, his
<i>primeir seizin</i>, which was the whole year’s value. Another grievance was
with respect to the wardship of military tenants under age. As to the tenants
<i>in capite</i>, the king had, by his prerogative, a right not only to the
wardship of the person of his minor tenant, and of the lands he held of him
<i>in capite</i>, but also of all other lands held by knight-service of any other person.
For as to socage lands, they were to be in the hands of the next of
kin, to whom the inheritance could not descend, who, at the infant’s full
age, was to be accountable for the profits: and under the pretence of such
tenants, upon the superior lord’s escheat, becoming tenants <i>in capite</i>, John
claimed and exacted the privilege, to the detriment of the other lords.
These and other mischiefs, for others there were, as I observed before, and
some of them are mentioned in this statute, are remedied by the general
provision which restored the feudal law, that the king should hold all such
escheated lordships in the same right they were before held, and have no
other privilege, but what the lord by whose escheat they fell to him had:
in a word, that he should hold them as lord of that lordship, not as king<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span></p>

<p>The thirty-second chapter relates to the alienation of lands, and gives a
qualified power of that kind. By the feudal law, as it was introduced at
the Conquest, no lord could alien his seignory without the tenants consent,
so neither could the tenant his tenancy, without approbation of the lord.
These strict rules were first broken into, in those superstitious times, in favour
of churchmen; afterwards, in Richard the First’s time, to raise money
for the holy war. Not but the subjects, by their insisting on Edward
the Confessor’s laws, of which free alienation was a part, seemed to be
fond of it. However, the kings, in all their grants of the old English laws,
were careful to preserve the feudal system, in guarding against the alienation
of the military tenures. Coke, on commenting in this statute, in order to
the better understanding thereof, makes three observations relative to
what was the common law before this statute; in the last of which I apprehend
he is mistaken, as the law then stood; and that what he asserts therein
to have been law did not become (so though often in practice) till after
the statute <i>quia emptores terrarum</i>, in Edward the First’s reign.</p>

<p>His first observation is, that the tenant might have made a feoffment of
the whole, or a part of his tenancy, to hold <i>of himself</i>; and no doubt but
he might. This was the usual case of subinfudation, by which the lord
was in no sort prejudiced; for his seignory remained entire, and he might
distrain in any part for his whole service; and in such case, if the under
tenant was aggrieved, he was to have his remedy against his immediate
landlord the <i>mesne</i>, (or middle person), as he is called in our law.</p>

<p>The second observation is, that the tenant could not alien in fee <i>apart</i> of
the tenancy, to hold, not of himself, but of the lord, than which nothing
could be more reasonable; for it would have been against these old rules
also, for a tenant to bring in another, as immediate vassal to the lord, without
his the lord’s consent. The tenant would by that means dismember
the seignory, which he received, entire, and so deprive the lord of his
right of distraining in the whole, and confine him merely to that part remaining
in his own hands, as original tenant. For as to the part of the
<i>allienee</i>, he could not distrain that for his service, there having been no feudal
contract between them. Such alienation, therefore, unless when the
lord accepted the <i>allienee</i> as a tenant, was a breach of fealty, and against
the old feudal principles, and consequently unlawful in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span></p>

<p>The third observation Coke makes on this statute, is, that by the common
law the tenant might have made a feoffment of the whole tenancy,
to be holden of the lord. For, says he, that was no prejudice at all to the
lord<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. But though this certainly prevailed as common law, long before either
Coke or Littleton wrote, I cannot help thinking, both because it was
contrary to the old feudal law, and also from the words of the statute <i>quia
emptores terrarum</i>, that it was first introduced by that act of parliament, the
words of which are, <i>de cætero liceat unicuique libero homini terras suas, seu tenementa
sua vel partem, inde vendere</i>. Here the alienating the whole is declared
from henceforth lawful; which words had been nugatory, if this
had been common law before.</p>

<p>The chapter of <i>Magna Charta</i> of which we are speaking, was, then, the
first positive law that allowed the free alienation of lands. It, in one sense,
enlarged, whilst in another it expressly restrained, the power of the tenant;
whereas, before, he might alien the whole, or part of his tenancy in fee,
but subject to the distress of the lord. Now, by this statute, he was confined
to an alienation only for so much, that, out of what remained, the lord
might have sufficient distress for his entire service, and the part conveyed
was in the <i>alienee</i>’s hands, free from any future distress by the lord, or service
due to him, fealty only excepted. But it not being specified, how much
of the land was a sufficiency, though the half, or what was the half in value,
was, in common estimation, reputed such, the tenants, under this pretence,
would alien more; which gave occasion to many disputes and suits,
and the propensity to general alienations continuing, the law called <i>quia emptores
terrarum</i>, already mentioned, was at length made, which gave a general
licence to alien the whole, or a part at pleasure, to hold of the superior
lord; and this put an end, in the law of England, to subinfudation of fee
simples. For, since the passing that law, if a man infeoffs another of the
whole or part of his land, there is no tenure between the feoffer and feoffee,
but the feoffee holds of the feoffer’s lord. But as to lower estates, as fee
tail estates for life, years, or at will, subinfudation remains; because the
whole estate is not out of the donor, or lessor, but a reversion remains in
him; wherefore the tenure, in such case, is of the donor or lessor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span></p>

<p>By the statute of <i>Magna Charta</i>, in case of alienation of part, to hold of
the lord, the residue remaining in the original tenant’s hands, was to answer
the services, and the <i>alienee</i> held of the lord, by fealty only. But now by
the second chapter of the forementioned statute, the services were to be apportioned,
that is, divided in proportion to the value of the lands. If half
of the lands, not in <i>extent</i>, but <i>value</i>, was aliened, the <i>alienee</i> paid half: if
one third, the like quantity. I have observed before, on this statute of
<i>quia emptores</i>, that the king, not being named, was not bound by it. For
his tenant <i>in capite</i> to alien without licence was a forfeiture, until, in the
reign of Edward the Third, a fine for alienating was substituted in the place
of the forfeiture, which fine continued until the restoration, when it was
abolished.</p>

<p>The thirty-third chapter provides, that the patrons, that is, the heirs
of the founders of abbeys, who, by title under the king’s letters patent, or
by tenure, or antient possession, were intitled to the custody of temporalities,
during the vacancy of the abbey, should enjoy them free from molestation
of any person, or of the king, under the pretence of the prerogative<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.</p>

<p>The thirty-fourth chapter is relative to appeals of murder, brought by
private persons. When a man is murdered, not only the king, who is
injured by the loss of a subject, may prosecute the offender, but also the
party principally injured, that is, the widow of the deceased, if he had one;
for she, as having one person with him, stands intitled to this remedy in
the first place; but if he left no widow, his heir at law might pursue it. It
follows, therefore, that a female heir might, by the common law, have
brought an appeal of murder, as the daughter, or the sister, if there had
been neither children or brother. But this statute alters the common law,
and takes away the appeal, in such case, from every woman, except the
widow; so that, at this day, if a man be murdered, leaving no widow,
and his next heir be a female, no appeal of murder can be brought. But
this disability is personal to women; for though a daughter or sister,
living, can bring no appeal, though heir, yet, if they be dead before the
murder, leaving a son who is heir, he may bring it<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span></p>

<p>I shall now make a few observations on the right of the widow’s bringing
such appeal. First, then, the man slain must be <i>vir suus</i>, as the statute
expresses it. If, therefore, they had been divorced, the marriage being
dissolved, she could not have an appeal. It was otherwise, if they had
been only separated <i>a mensâ &amp; thoro</i>; for then he still continued her husband.
He ceases likewise to be <i>vir suus</i>, if she ceases to be his wife, or
widow. Therefore, by her marrying again, her appeal is gone, even
though the second husband should die within the year, the time limited for
bringing it. This is carried so far, that though she brings an appeal while
a widow, yet if she marries while it is depending, it shall abate for ever.
So if she has obtained judgment of death against the <i>appellee</i>, if she marries
before execution, she can never have execution against him. In one
point the heir is less favoured in appeals than the widow; for if the person
murdered had been attainted of high treason, or felony, so that his blood
was corrupted, the heir could not have it; for the civil relation between
them was extinguished, by the ancestor’s civil death: but the relation of
husband and wife depends on the law of God, who has declared the bond
indissoluble; therefore no law of man can make him cease to be <i>vir suus</i>,
and, in such case, she shall have an appeal.</p>

<p>The thirty-fifth chapter treats of the county-courts<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>; but having already,
in a former lecture, mentioned what appeared to me sufficient on that subject,
I shall proceed to the next, viz. the first law made to prevent alienations
in mortmain. Lands given to a corporation, whether spiritual or lay,
are said to fall into <i>mortmain</i>, that is, into a dead hand, an hand useless and
unprofitable to the lord of the fee, from whom he could never receive the
fruits. There could be no escheat, either for want of heirs, or felony, because
the body never died, nor was capable of committing felony. For the
same reason of its never dying, there could be no wardship, or relief; neither
could there be marriage. But besides the loss to the lords, the public
also suffered; for the military service the lands were subject to, were often
withdrawn, or, at least, very insufficiently performed.</p>

<p>These alienations, without the consent of the superior lord, were directly
against the feudal polity; yet such was the power of the clergy, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
the principal gainers thereby, in those ages, and so great their influence,
that they were not only tolerated, but universally practised, through all
Europe; for the founding of a monastery was the usual atonement for the
most atrocious crimes. In England, particularly, from the accession of the
Conqueror to that of John, containing one hundred and thirty-four years,
there were no less than an hundred and four monasteries founded, many of
them very richly endowed, besides particular benefactions made to them
and the old ones. No wonder, then, it was found necessary, by laws, to
put a stop to the growing wealth of the church; but the reign of John, a
vassal to the Pope, was not a time to expect a remedy. Accordingly, this
act goes no farther than to remedy a collusive practice, by which a vassal,
to defraud his lord of the fruits of his seignory, made over his lands to a
convent, and took it back to hold from them; and to that end, the statute
declares the land, in such case, forfeited to the lord.</p>

<p>I shall say no more on this point, nor of the many cunning practices
churchmen, in after times, put in use by the advice of the most learned
lawyers they could procure, in order to creep out of this, and every other
statute made to restrain them, and for employing which, Coke says, they
were much to be commended. But he has forgot to tell us whether he
thought those great lawyers deserved commendation, for finding means to
elude the most beneficial laws of the land. It will be enough here to say,
that, from these devices, arose, in time, the wide-spreading doctrine of <i>uses
and trusts</i>, which have over-run our whole law, and that the judicial powers
of courts of equity have grown with them<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.</p>

<p>The next chapter was made to restrain the intolerable exactions of <i>escuage</i>
which John had introduced, and forbids the assessing it, in any other manner
than was used in the time of Henry the Second, his father, that is, as
I observed under that reign, very moderately; so that every man had his
option, whether he would serve in person, or pay it<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.</p>

<p>Next comes the thirty-eighth, which is the conclusion. First, it saves to
the subjects all other rights and privileges before had, though not mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
herein. Coke observes, that there is no saving for the <i>prerogative of
the king</i>, or his heirs; for that would have rendered all illusory. Secondly,
it ordains that the king and his heirs should observe it. Thirdly, that all
the subjects should. Fourthly, it recites, that, in consideration hereof, the
king received from the subjects a grant of the fifteenth of their moveables.
For <i>Magna Charta</i> is not merely a declaration of the old laws, but alters
them in many instances; for which favourable alterations the subjects made
this grant, and thereby became purchasers of them. Fifthly, it prohibites
the king, and his heirs, from doing any thing whereby these liberties might
be infringed or weakened; and declares all such doings null and void.
Lastly, comes the alteration of twelve bishops, and nineteen abbots, and
thirty-one earls and barons<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>.</p>

Mercen-lage and Dane-lage, was not of any importance. These differed not
essentially from one another. “Our Saxons, says Sir Henry Spelman, though divided
into many kingdoms, yet were they all one in effect, in manners, laws and
language: So that the breaking of their government into many kingdoms, or
the reuniting of their kingdoms into a monarchy, wrought little or no change
amongst them touching laws. For, though we talk of the <i>West-Saxon-law</i>, the
<i>Mercian-law</i> and the <i>Dane-law</i>, whereby the west parts of <i>England</i>, the middle
parts, and those of <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i> and the north, were severally governed; yet
held they all an uniformity in substance, differing rather in their <i>mulcts</i> than in
their <i>canea</i>; that is, in the quantity of fines and amerciaments, than in the
course and frame of justice.” <i>Relig. Spelm.</i> p. 49.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> King Edward’s laws were compiled from those of former princes, and abolished
any little peculiarities which distinguished the West-Saxon, Mercian and Danish
laws, subjecting the whole kingdom to a common law. His code, accordingly, was
termed <i>lex Angliæ</i>, or <i>lex terræ</i>. No correct copy of it has descended to us.
Those regulations, which pass under his name in the editions of the Saxon-laws
by Lambard and Wilkins, have evidently some interpolations. Traces of them
are to be seen in Hoveden and Knyghton; and remains of them are likeways to be
found in the laws of William I. From the time of this Prince to that of King
John, they continued, with the addition of some Norman laws and customs, the
law of the land. <i>Præcipimus</i>, says William, <i>ut omnes habeant et teneant leges
Edwardi regis in omnibus rebus, adauctis his quas constituimus ad utilitatem Anglorum</i>.
<i>Leg. Guliel. ap.</i> Wilkins, p. 229. By the influence of the Barons under the last
Prince, they were drawn up in the form of <i>Magna Charta</i>. For the <i>great charter</i>
was not what some partial writers have represented it, a concession of privileges
extorted by violence, but a declaration of the principal grounds of the <i>antient</i> and
fundamental laws of England, and a correction of the defects of the common law.

The spiritual lords were the bishops and dignitaries of the church, whose possessions
were held in Frankalmoigne. After the conquest, they were subjected to military
service and held by barony. What may seem extraordinary, Abesses were
also in use to sit in the Saxon Wittenagemots. In Wightred’s great council at
Beconceld, <i>anno</i> 694. the Abesses sat and deliberated, and several of them subscribed
the decrees made in it. <i>Spel. conc. vol. I.</i> The abesses appeared also in Ethelwolf’s

were summoned to parliament; those of Shaftsbury, Berking, St. Mary of
Winchester, and of Wilton. <i>Tit. hon. p. 729, and Whitelock’s notes upon the king’s

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The preambles of the Saxon laws express an anxiety to please the people,
and allude to their consent in enacting them. The laws of king Ina begin thus:
<i>Ego Ina Dei gratia Occiduorum Saxonum Rex, cum consilio et cum doctrina Cenredæ
patris mei, et Heddæ Episcopi mei, et cum omnibus meis senatoribus, et senioribus <span class="smcap">sapientibus
populi mei</span>, et multa etiam societate ministrorum Dei, consultabam de
salute animæ nostræ, et de fundamento regni nostri, ut justæ leges, et justa statuta per
ditionem nostram stabilita et constituta essent, ut nullus senator nec subditus noster post
hæc has nostras leges infringeret</i>. See <i>LL. Anglo-Saxon, ap. Wilkins, p. 14.</i> The
preambles to the laws of the other princes are nearly similar; and those of Edgar,
Ethelred and Canute, may serve as additional examples. 1. Leges Eadgari
regis. <i>Hoc et institutum quod Eadgarus cum <span class="smcap">sapientum suorum</span> consilio instituit
in gloriam Dei, et sibi ipsi in dignitatem regiam, et in utilitatem omni populo suo</i>. 2.
Leges Æthelredi regis. <i>Hoc est consilium quod Æthelredus rex, et <span class="smcap">sapientes ejus</span>
consultaverunt ad emendationem pacis omni populo Wodstoci in regione Merciorum, secundum
Angliæ leges</i>. 3. Leges Cnuti regis. <i>Hoc est consilium quod Cnutus rex,
totius Angliæ et Danorum et Norwegorum rex, cum <span class="smcap">sapientum suorum</span> consilio sancivit,
in laudem Dei, et sibi ipsi in ornamentum regium, et ad utilitatem populi; et hoc
erat sacris natalibus domini nostri Wintoniæ</i>. See <i>Wilkins</i>, p. 76. 102. 126.</p>

<p>In the 8th law of Edward the Confessor we read, <i>Hæc concessa sunt a rege, baronibus
et <span class="smcap">populo</span></i>; and in his 35th law we have the following words: <i>Hoc enim
factum fuit per <span class="smcap">commune consilium</span> et <span class="smcap">assensum</span> omnium episcoporum, principum,
procerum, comitum, et omnium <span class="smcap">sapientum</span> seniorum et <span class="smcap">populorum</span> totius
regni, et per præceptum regis Inæ prædicti.</i> See Wilkins, p. 198. The laws of
Edward are, I know, to be read with distrust; but they are allowed to contain
genuine relics of that prince; and, in the present case, there seems no reason
for suspicion. Their <i>appeal</i> of consequence to the <i>assent</i> of the <i>people</i> must be
allowed to be of authority. For, if such <i>assent</i> was not known and believed in
that age, how is it possible that they could appeal to it? The advocates for the
late origin of the house of commons will not surely suppose, that the Confessor
alluded prophetically to transactions which were not to happen till the reigns of
Henry III. and Edward I.</p>

<p>In the <i>Mirroire de Justices</i>, it is expressly said, that no king, during the Saxon
times, could change his money, nor enhance nor impair it, nor make any money
but of silver, without the <i>assent</i> of the <i>Lords</i> and all the <span class="smcap">Commons</span>. Part of this
book is conceived by Sir Edward Coke to have been written before the conquest;
and additions were made to it by Andrew Horn in the reign of Edward I. from
old MSS. the authors of which must have seen ancient rolls and records. Matter,
also, from more exceptionable materials, it is to be thought, was superadded
by him. The book is notwithstanding of considerable weight and authority.
<i>Mirroire des Justices</i>, cap. 1. sect. 3. <i>Atkyns on the power of parliament.</i></p>

<p>Concerning the high antiquity of the <i>commons</i>, Sir Edward Coke is clear and
explicit; and he has founded chiefly his opinion on the ancient tract, which bears
this title: <i>Modus quomodo parliamentum regis Angliæ et <span class="smcap">Anglorum suorum</span>, tenebatur
<span class="smcap">temporibus regis Edwardi</span>, filii <span class="smcap">regis</span> Ethelredi, qui modus recitatus fuit
per discretiores regni coram Willielmo duce Normanniæ conquestore et rege Angliæ,
ipso conquestore hoc præcipiente, et per ipsum approbatus, et suis temporibus et temporibus
successorum suorum regum Angliæ usitatus.</i> Other authors beside Lord
Coke have paid great respect to this treatise. It is to be acknowledged, however,
that Mr Selden has demonstrated that this tract could not possibly be of the age of
the Confessor, from its employing terms which were not in use till long after.
But this does not wholly derogate from its force as to the point in question.
For, allowing it to have been written in the reign of Edward III. the period which,
with great probability, some writers have assigned to it, it yet proves that the sense of
that period was full and strong with regard to the antiquity of the constitution, as
consisting of king, lords and <i>commons</i>; a circumstance which must have great
weight in opposition to those, who would make us believe, that our constitution,
as so formed, was unknown till the times of Henry III. and Edward I. <i>4 Institute</i>,

<p>“In the time of king Canutus, says Whitelocke, to a charter then graunted to
the monastery of St. Edmond’s Bury (probably in a publique councell) after the
subscriptions of the queen and dukes, followes, <i>I Oslaus, <span class="smcap">knight</span></i>, <i>I Thored,
<span class="smcap">knight</span></i>, <i>I Thurkell, <span class="smcap">knight</span></i>, and so of others. How many these were, or how
for several counties, doth not appear; nor in that parlement of the same king
(for so is testified by the discription of it) where it is sayd, that <i>the king calling
all the prælats of his kingdome, and the nobles, and great men to his parlement</i>,
there were present bishops, abbots, dukes, earles, <i>with many <span class="smcap">militibus</span></i>, butte
the certain number is not extant; nor of those which are mentioned in the parlement
of Edward the Confessor, where after the king, queen, archbishops, bishops,
abbots, king’s chapleins, Thaines, <span class="smcap">knights</span> are reckoned in that parlement.”
<i>Notes upon the king’s writ</i>, vol. I. p. 437.</p>

<p>Lambard, Dugdale, and other antiquaries, produce a very strong evidence of the
antiquity of the representation of boroughs, by evincing, “That in every quarter
of the realm, a great many boroughs do yet send burgesses to parliament, which
are nevertheless so ancient, and so long since decayed, and gone to nought, that
it cannot be shewed that they have been of any reputation at any time since the
Conquest; and much less that they have obtained this privilege by the grant of
any king succeeding the same. So that the interest which they have in parliament
groweth by an ancient usage before the Conquest, whereof they cannot
shew any beginning.” <i>Lambard Archeion</i>, <i>p.</i> 256. 257. <i>Coke Epist.</i> 9. <i>Rep.
Dugdale, Jurid.</i> <i>p.</i> 15.</p>

<p>This matter receives confirmation from what we are told of the <i>boroughs of ancient
demesne</i>. “These, says Whitelocke, were tenants of the demesne lands of
William I. and of Edward the Confessor; who (to the end that they might not
be hindered from their business of husbandry of the king’s lands) had many privileges,
whereof one was, that they should not be compelled to serve in parliament.
Another was, that they should not contribute to the wages of <span class="smcap">knights
of the shire</span>. Which privileges they still enjoy, and had their beginning in
the times of William I. and of the Confessor, whose tenants they first were, as
appears in the book of Domesday, and is a strong proof, that <span class="smcap">knights</span> and <span class="smcap">Burgesses</span>
were then in parliament.” <i>Notes upon the Kings Writ</i>, vol. <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> p. 139.</p>

dominium minus obtineret, licet nobilis esset, inter proceres <span class="smcap">tunc</span> nuncupari non potuit</i>.
It is somewhat remarkable, that Mr Hume is among those, who, resting on this
foundation, would make us conceive, that a person who had 40 hides of land,
could, without being noble, give his voice in the Wittenagemot. <i>Hist. of Eng.
vol. I. p. 145.</i> The passage, however, properly understood, serves to shew, that, in the
course of time, the attendance of the Nobles in parliament, having been deemed an
expensive service, a law was made to relieve those of them from it who were not
possessed of 40 hides of land. The reader may consult <i>hist. Eliens. c. 36. 40. ap.

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> The Confessor dying without issue, the competitors for the crown were
Edgar Atheling, Harold, and duke William. The first had not capacity to sway
the sceptre; and the succession of kings was not yet directed by very regular
maxims. Harold was a subject, and in possession of no legal claim. William was
related to Edward, and urged the destination of that prince to succeed him. On
these grounds he invaded England; and by opposing Harold, he meant to secure
what was his right of succession. His victory accordingly gave him the capacity of
a successor, and not of a conqueror. That the quarrel was personal with Harold
may be even conceived from the circumstance that duke William offered to decide
their dispute by single combat. <i>Hale, hist. of the com. law, ch. v. Cook, argument.
antinorm.</i></p>

<p>With regard to William’s right of succession, the best account appears to be that
which is found in Ingulphus, William of Poictiers, William Gemetensis, and Ordericus
Vitalis, who were all of them his contemporaries. These authors inform us,
that king Edward sent Harold into Normandy to assure duke William of his having
destined him to be his successor to the crown of England; a destination which
he had before observed to him by Robert Archbishop of Canterbury; and which
appears to have been made with the consent of the national council. And of this
relation there remains a very curious and decisive confirmation. It is a tapestry
found at Bayeux, and supposed to be work of Matilda the wife of duke William,
and of the ladies of her court, in which Harold is represented on his embassy. See
<i>a description of this tapestry by Smart Lethieullier, Esq; ap. Du Carrel’s Anglo-Norman
antiquities</i>. It is surprising, when these particulars are considered, that Mr.
Hume should have given his sanction to the opinion that William’s right was entirely
by war, and that he should have conceived that those who refuse to this
prince the title of <i>Conqueror</i> should rest solely or chiefly on the pretence that the
word <i>conqueror</i> is in old books and records applied to such as make an acquisition
of territory by any means. <i>Hist. of Eng. vol. 1. p. 200.</i> It is true, that Sir Henry
Spelman and other antiquaries have shown, that <i>conquestus</i> and <i>conquisitio</i> were
in the age of duke William synonymous with <i>acquisitio</i>; but it is no less true,
that the authors who refuse to duke William the title of Conqueror, rest on much
superior evidence. It is not with pleasure that I differ from this great authority;
but, no man has a title to enquire who will not think for himself; and the most
perfect productions of human wit have their errors and their blemishes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> The first summons of knights extant on record is supposed to be in the 49th
of Henry III. But this, though it were true, does not prove that knights were not
known till that time. The writ does not say so; nor can it be gathered from it,
that <i>knights of the shire</i> were then <i>newly</i> established. If there remained, indeed,
an uniform series of records from the earliest times, in which there was no mention
of <i>knights</i> till the age of Henry III. there might thence arise a strong argument
against their antiquity. But this is not the case; and it happens, that in the
15th year of king John, there is a writ to the sheriff to summon <i><span class="smcap">four</span> knights
of the county</i>; <i>15. Jo. Rs. rot. claus. pt. 2. m. 7. dorso. 4 discretos milites, de comitatu
suo, ad loquendum nobiscum</i>. There is also similar evidence, that in the 32d and
42d years of Henry III. <i>knights</i> made their appearance in parliament. <i>Whitelocke,
Notes, vol. I. 438. vol. II. 120.</i> In the close roll, also, of the 38th year of Henry III.
there is extant a writ of summons directed to the sheriffs of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire,
requiring <i><span class="smcap">two</span> knights</i> to be sent for each of these counties. <i>Lyttelton,
Hist. Henry II. notes to the 2d book, p. 70. 79.</i> In ancient times, it was usual
to summon sometimes <i><span class="smcap">four</span> knights</i>, sometimes <span class="smcap">three</span>, sometimes <span class="smcap">two</span>, and even
sometimes <i><span class="smcap">one</span> knight</i>. But from the reign of Edward III. it has been the constant
practice for the sheriff to return <i><span class="smcap">two</span> knights</i> for each county. <i>Whitelocke, vol. I. 439.</i></p>

<p>The first summons directed to the sheriff for the election of <i>citizens</i> and <i>burgesses</i>,
is supposed to be in the 23d of Edward I. But in the sixth year of king
John, says Whitelocke, there is extant on record a writ to the sheriff, which mentions
“Bishops, earls, barons, and <i>all our faithful people in England</i>; by whose
assent, lawes were then made.” <i>6. Jo. regis, rot. claus. m. 3. dors. et rot. pat.
m. 2. Assensu archiepis. &amp;c. et omnium fidelium nostrorum Angliæ. Notes on the
king’s writ, vol. II. p. 120.</i> An ordinance in this year of king John, directed <i>to all
the sheriffs</i> in England, is mentioned from the records by Sir Robert Cotton, and
has these words: <i>Provisum est <span class="smcap">assensu</span> Archiepiscoporum, comitum, baronum, et
<span class="smcap">omnium fidelium nostrorum Angliae</span>.</i> <i>Cotton. posth. p. 15.</i></p>

<p>In the <i>conventio inter regem Johannem et barones</i> the people are stated as parties;
a circumstance which would not have happened if they had not been represented.
<i>Hæc est conventio facta inter dominum Johannem regem Angliæ ex una parte, et Robertum
filium Walteri Marescallum, &amp;c. <span class="smcap">et liberos homines totius regni</span> ex
altera parte</i>. Blackstone’s Edition of the charters, ap. Law Tracts, vol. II.
p. 39. 40. And what confirms this notion is, that we find the <i>mayor of London</i>
and the <i>constable of Chester</i> in the list of those who were chosen conservators of the
public liberties in consequence of the great charter. Other proofs, likeways,
of the antiquity of the commons are to be found in the great charters. See
Lyttelton, Hist. Henry II. Notes to the 2d book, p. 71.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of notice, that the 25th of Edward I. which confirms the great
charter, observes, that it was made by the <i>common assent of all the realm</i>: And
the 15th of Edward III. observes, that it was made <i>par le roy, ses piers, et la communalté
de la terre</i>.</p>

<p>Nor must it be omitted, that the 5th of Richard II. has this remarkable passage:
<i>The king doth will and command, and it is assented in the parliament, by the prelates,
lords and <span class="smcap">commons</span>, that all and singular persons and commonalties, which from
henceforth shall have the summons of the parliament, shall come from henceforth to the
parliaments in the manner as they are bound to do, and have been accustomed within
the realm of England <span class="smcap">of old times</span>. And if any person of the same realm, which
from henceforth shall have the said summons (be he archbishop, bishop, abbot, prior,
duke, earl, baron, banneret, <span class="smcap">knight</span> of the shire, <span class="smcap">citizen</span> of city, <span class="smcap">burgess</span> of
borough, or other singular person, or commonalty) do absent himself, and come not at
the said summons (except he may reasonably and honestly excuse him to our lord the
king) he shall be amerced, and otherwise punished, according as <span class="smcap">of old times</span> hath
been used to be done within the said realm in the said case. And if any sheriff of the
realm be from henceforth negligent in making his returns of writs of the parliament;
or that he leave out of the said returns <span class="smcap">any cities or borough which be bound
and of old time were wont to come to the parliament</span>, he shall be amerced,
or otherwise punished in the manner as was accustomed to be done in the said
case</i> in times past. <i>Stat. 2. cap. 4.</i></p>

<p>The expression “of old time,” so often used here, must doubtless carry us farther
back than the 23d of Edward I. or even the 49th of Henry III. The space
of two or even three reigns does not make a period of antiquity. We do not say,
that the accession of George I. was in <i>ancient times</i>.</p>

<p>I know well, that the expressions <i>commonalty</i>, <i>communitas regni</i>, <i>baronagium Angliæ</i>,
<i>magnates</i>, <i>nobiles</i>, <i>proceres</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> have been considered as solely applicable to
barons and tenants <i>in capite</i>. But one must beware of giving credit to this opinion.
The great charter of king John bears to have been made <i>per regem, barones
et liberos homines totius regni</i>; a certain proof that it was not made by the king
and the barons only; yet Henry III. speaking of this parliament, calls it <i>baronagium
Angliæ</i>. The <i>magnates</i> and <i>proceres</i> are said to have made the statute of Mortmain;
but it is well known, that the parliament which gave authority to this act
consisted of king, lords and <i>Commons</i>. In the 35th of Edward I. the expression <i>cum
comitibus, baronibus, proceribus, nobilibus, ac communitatibus</i>, evidently refers to
<span class="smcap">knights</span>, <span class="smcap">citizens</span> and <span class="smcap">burgesses</span>: And in the 14th of Edward III. <i>commonalty</i>
and <i>Commons</i> are used as synonymous. See farther, <i>Whitelocke, vol. II. ch. 81</i>.
<i>Coke, 2nd Inst. 583.</i> <i>Petyt, Rights of the Commons.</i> <i>Atkyns, on the power and jurisdiction
of parliament.</i></p>

<p>Mr Hume, I am sensible, strenuously asserts the late origin of the Commons; and
one would almost imagine, that his history of England had been written to prove
it. His reasonings, however, on constitutional points, do not appear to me to be
always decisive; and it is with pain I observe the respect which this great man has
paid to the opinions of Dr Brady; a writer who is known to have disgraced excellent
talents, by pleading the cause of a faction, and giving a varnish to tyranny.</p>

<p>The brevity which was necessary to this tract, has permitted me rather to hint
at, than to treat the antiquity of the Commons. In a work which I hope one day
to lay before the public, I shall have an opportunity of entering into it at greater
length.</p>

sovereign, naturally suggested to the people the petitioning for redress when under
the pressure of any grievance; and the crown, where it expected much, would
not naturally exercise a rigorous severity.</p>

<p>The term <i>petitioners</i> indeed, has, by some authors, been considered as reproachful
to the <i>Commons</i>; but how a petition, as the spring of a law, could have
meanness in it, is inconceivable. Even in the free age of Charlemagne, this mode
of application was employed. <i>Baluz. capit. reg. Franc. tom. 1.</i> The behaving
with reverence to the sovereign is very different from acting with servility. And
as to the petitioning against grievances, it is to be remembered, that respectful requisitions
of ancient and constitutional privileges, which had suffered invasion, are
not to be considered as mean solicitations for acts of favour.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> <i>Conf. Cart. an. 25. Ed. I.</i> It is singular, that even after the times of Edward
I. some writers will not allow, that the Commons were any essential branch
of the legislature; yet the writ of summons expresses in strong terms their right of
assent: <i>Ad audiendum et faciendum et consentiendum</i>; and a multitude of examples
may be produced of their actually consulting and determining about peace and
war and other important matters of state.</p>

<p>There is evidence that Edward I. called a parliament, and consulted with the
Lords and <i>Commons</i> about the conquest of Wales; and that on receiving information
that the French King intended to invade some of his dominions in France, he
summoned a parliament <i>ad tractand. ordinand. et faciend. cum prælatis, proceribus
et aliis incolis regni quibuslibet, hujusmodi periculis et excogitatis malis sit objurand</i>.
Inserting in the writ these memorable words, <i>Lex justissima, provida circumspectione
stabilita</i>: <span class="smcap">Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus approbetur</span>.</p>

<p>Edward II. consulted with his <span class="smcap">people</span> in his first year <i>pro solemnitate sponsalium
et coronationis</i>; and in his sixth year he consulted them, <i>super diversis negotiis statum
regni et expeditionem <span class="smcap">guerrae Scotiae</span> specialiter tangentibus</i><a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>.</p>

<p>Edward III. summoned the peers and <i>Commons</i> in his first year to consult them,
Whether they would resolve on peace or war with the Scottish king. In his sixth year,
he assembled the lords and <i>Commons</i>, and required their advice, Whether he should
undertake an expedition to the Holy Land. The lords and <i>Commons</i> consulted accordingly;
and while they applauded his religious and princely forwardness to the
holy enterprize, advised a delay of it for that season. In his thirteenth year, the
parliament assembled <i>avisamento prælatorum, procerum, necnon <span class="smcap">communitatis</span></i>
to advise <i>de expeditione <span class="smcap">guerrae</span> in partibus transmarinis</i>; and ordinances were made
for provision of ships, arraying of men for the marches, and defence of the isle of
Jersey. In his fortieth year, the Pope demanding the tribute of king John, the
parliament assembled, where, after consultation apart, the prelates, lords and <i>Commons</i>
advise the refusal of it, <i>although it be by the dint of the sword</i>.</p>

<p>Richard II. in the first year of his reign, advised with the peers and <i>Commons</i>, How
he should best resist his enemies? In the second year, he consulted his <i>people</i> how to
withstand the Scots; who had combined against him with France. In the sixth
year, he consulted the parliament about the defence of the borders; his
possessions beyond sea, <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Gascoyne</i>, his subjects in <i>Portugal</i>, and safe
keeping of the seas; and whether he should proceed by treaty or alliance,
or the duke of Lancaster by force? The lords approved the duke’s intention for
Portugal; and the <i>Commons</i> advised, that Thomas bishop of Norwich, having the
Pope’s <i>croiceris</i>, should invade France. In his fourteenth year, this prince advised
with the lords and <i>Commons</i> for the war with Scotland, and would not, without
their counsels, conclude a final peace with France. And the year ensuing the
<i>Commons</i> interested the king to use moderation in the law of provisions, and proposed
that the duke of Aquitaine should be employed to negotiate the peace with
France.</p>

<p>With regard to the power of the <i>Commons</i> as to <i>judicature</i> in the times of which
we speak, there are not wanting decisive proofs. In the reign of Edward II. the
peers and <i>Commons</i> gave consent and judgment to the revocation and reversement
of the sentence of banishment of the two Spencers<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>. In the first year of Edward III.
when <i>Elizabeth</i> the widow of <i>Sir John de Burgo</i> complained in parliament, that
Hugh Spencer the younger, Robert Baldock and William Cliffe his instruments, had
by duress forced her to make a writing to the king, in consequence of which she
was despoiled of her inheritance, sentence was given for her by the prelates, lords
and <i>Commons</i>. In the 4th year of Edward III. it appears by a letter to the pope,
that to the sentence given against the earl of Kent, the <i>Commons</i> were parties as
well as the peers, for the king directed their proceedings in these words: <i>Comitibus,
magnatibus, baronibus, et aliis de <span class="smcap">communitate</span> dicti regni ad parliamentum
illud congregatis injunximus, ut super his discernerent et <span class="smcap">judicarent</span> quod rationi et
justiciæ conveniret</i>. When in the first year of Richard II. William Weston and
John Jennings were arraigned in parliament for surrendering certain forts to the
king; the <i>Commons</i> were parties to the sentence against them, as appears from a
writing annexed to the record. In the first year of Henry IV. although the <i>Commons</i>
refer by protestation, the pronouncing the sentence of deposition against
King Richard II. to the lords, yet they were equally interested in it, as is evident
from the record; for there were made proctors or commissioners for the whole
parliament, one bishop, one earl, one abbot, one baronet, and two knights. “And to
infer, says a learned and accurate author<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>, that because the lords pronounced the
sentence, the point of judgment should be only theirs, were as absurd as to conclude
that no authority was left in any other commissioner of <i>oyer and terminer</i>
than in the person of that man solely that speaketh the sentence.” In the
second year of Henry V. the petition of the Commons imported no less than a
<i><span class="smcap">right</span> to act and assent to all things in parliament</i>; and the king allowed that they
possessed this right.</p>

<p>These examples of the importance of the people are striking; and they are supported
by the authority of the parliament-rolls, or by records above exception.
The curious reader may see them, and other proofs to the same purpose, in the
posthumous pieces of Sir Robert Cotton.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> In the year 1546, there were 126 boroughs that returned members to parliament;
and the greatest number of these were wealthy and populous. <i>Brown
Willis, notit. parliam. vol. I.</i> In the reign of Edward VI. 23 new boroughs were summoned
to send burgesses to parliament. Philip and Mary added 13 more, Elizabeth
30, James the 2 universities and 12 boroughs, Cha. I. 8 boroughs, and
Cha. II. the county of Durham and 2 boroughs. <i>Ellys on temporal liberty.</i> Anciently
the king might incorporate any town, and enable it to send burgesses to
parliament; but this privilege remains not at present with the crown. If the
king was now to venture on the creation of a parliamentary borough, it would rest
with the house of commons whether they would receive the members.</p>

parliaments called during her reign, not one became abortive by unkindness;
and yet not any one of them passed without subsidy granted by the people, but
one wherein none was desired. And sometimes the aid was so liberal, that she
refused the one half, and thanked the people for the remnant; a courtesy that
rang loud abroad, to the shame of other princes. She never altered, continued,
repealed, nor explained any law, otherwise than by act of parliament, whereof
there are multitudes of examples in the statutes of her reign.” <i>Nat. Bacon,
Discourse on the laws and government of England, part 2.</i></p>

<p>I do not mean to say, that Elizabeth, and the princes who preceded her, never
acted against the spirit of our government. Her reign, and those of many of her
predecessors, were doubtless stained with bold exertions of authority. But bold
exertions of authority must not be interpreted to infer despotism in our government.
We must separate the personal qualities of princes, and the principles of
the constitution. The government of England, and the administrations of its chief
magistrates, are very different things.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> <i>Hume, Hist. of England, vol. V. p. 462.</i> This historian, the most accomplished,
perhaps, who has written in modern times, has attempted to vindicate both
James and Charles; but he has done nothing more than to produce evidence to
shew, that in some respects they acted from precedents of administration in former
princes; and this, if taken even in the fullest extent, is insufficient to justify them.
Charles, however, it will be allowed, exceeded every violation of liberty, of which
there had been any example; and when he had consented to reduce the exorbitancy
of the regal power, his conduct created a suspicion of his sincerity. But
on the supposition that he did not advance his authority beyond the practice of former
times, he is not therefore to be vindicated. It is no exculpation of a crime
in one individual, that it has been committed by others. The advantages of a free
government belonged to the people of England; and they were the proper judges
when to enforce their privileges against an invader. They might pardon in one
sovereign what they would punish in another. They might overlook in Elizabeth
what they did not wish to excuse in Charles. The doctrine of resistance is delicate.
In a free constitution, like that of which we speak, the prince and the people
will often fall into situations where they seem to encroach, or actually do so, on the
rights of one another. But it is never on slight grounds that the people will be
prevailed upon to take arms against their chief magistrate. After all, had England
been an absolute monarchy, Was it thence proper and just that it should remain in
that situation? There are rights which it is impossible that men can either lose or
forfeit. No authority and no precedent, no usage and no law, can give a sanction
to tyranny.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
